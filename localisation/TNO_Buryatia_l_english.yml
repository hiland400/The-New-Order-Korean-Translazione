 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_VALERY_SABLIN_DESC:0 "1939년 레닌그라드 새해축하 행사 도중에 태어난 발레리 사블린은 일가족이 완전히 박살난 상임 간부회 잔당과 함께 동부로 피난갔을 때에도 고작 어린 아이였습니다. 그의 아버지는 최고소비에트 상임간부회의 일원이자 해군 장교로서 크릭스마리네를 맞이하기 위해 출항했고 파멸을 맞이했습니다. 아버지의 희생을 항상 마음 속에 새겨놓고 있었던 사블린은 거의 경험해 본 적도 없던 연방과 아버지가 목숨 바쳐가며 싸웠던 혁명을 꿈꾸며 자랐습니다. 야고다의 지휘력에 의구심을 품었음에도 불구하고 사블린은 자진해서 정치장교로 군에 입대했는데 이는 아고다의 전체주의적 제국에 대한 충성심의 발로가 아니라 아직까지 자리를 지키고 서있는 금방이라도 무너질듯한 사관학교 안 깊은 곳에서 자신이 품던 의문에 대한 대답을 찾을 수 있을지도 모른다는 어찌 보면 바보같은 희망에서 나온 결정이었습니다. 이것이 진짜로 이전 시대의 사람들이 원하던 것이었을까요? 그는 실망에 빠졌습니다. 그가 찾아낸 얼마 되지 않는 책들은 읽기 불가능할 정도로 검열된 상태였으며, NKVD가 언제 어디서나 그를 감시하고 있다는 사실을 깨달았기 때문이었습니다.\n\n중앙 시베리아 전쟁이 동부를 불태울 때에도 사블린은 충실히 복무했고 부하들에게 사회주의와 평등을 위해 싸우도록 사기를 북돋아 주는 역할을 수행했습니다. 하지만 부하들이 더 많은 지도를 원할수록 정말 자신이 옳은 편에 서 있는가 하는 의문은 커져만 갔습니다. 마침내 그의 의구심이 폭발했습니다. 사블린은 충성스러운 병사 몇 명을 데리고 라디오 방송국을 급습해 동방 전역에서 들을 수 있도록 방송을 내보냈습니다. 여기서 사블린은 러시아 인민들이 맞닥트린 고난에 대해 진심으로 이야기하고 야고다가 휘두르는 공포로부터 자유로우며 진정으로 평등한 사회주의 국가에 관한 꿈을 발표했습니다. 그는 누구도 자신의 발표를 들어주지 않으리라 믿었지만, 인민은 그의 발표를 경청해 주었습니다. 꿈을 가진 자, 반체제인사, 젊은이를 위시한 수많은 남녀가 그의 군세에 합류했습니다. 이제 사블린과 혁명가들은 꿈을 위해 궁극적인 희생을 할 준비를 마쳤고 미래를 위해 싸우고 있습니다."

 BRY_the_spark:0 "불꽃"
 BRY_the_spark_desc:0 "때가 왔습니다, 동지들! 폭군 야고다는 너무 오랫동안 그의 상아탑에 앉아 있었고 나머지 사람들은 흙 속에서 굶주렸습니다. 너무 오랫동안 NKVD의 부패한 자들이 거리를 배회하면서 우리의 친구들과 가족들을 한밤중에 데려가 다시는 볼 수 없게 했습니다. 원수를 갚는 프롤레타리아트의 유언은 이 일을 종지부를 찍어야 할 것입니다. 우리의 동지인 발레리 사블린이 앞장서 먼저 입장을 취했고, 폭군에게 먼저 의문을 제기하고 죽음을 정면으로 바라보며 '아니오'라고 말했습니다. 야고다의 발밑에 있는 것은 혁명의 불꽃이요, 때가 되면 그는 그 불길에 사로잡힐 것입니다."

 BRY_of_hope:0 "희망
 BRY_of_hope_desc:0 "동지들, 우리의 혁명은 굶주린 개의 광적인 물림도 아니고 불운한 사람의 힘겨운 몸부림도 아닙니다. 우리의 투쟁은 야고다와 그의 NKVD에 의해 우리에게 강요된 고통으로부터 태어난 영광스러운 것입니다. 하지만 그것보다, 언젠가는 그들의 투쟁은 보상을 받을 것이고, 그들의 투쟁은 헛되지 않을 것이라는 것이 국민들의 희망의 끝없는 정신의 구현입니다. 이를 위해, NKVD의 분노를 여전히 두려워하는 사람들에게 이 희망을 불어넣기 위한 조치가 이루어져야 합니다. 혁명은 투쟁하는 사람들의 사랑과 지지가 없이는 아무것도 아닙니다."

 BRY_for_our_families:0 "우리의 가족들을 위해"
 BRY_for_our_families_desc:0 "사랑할 가족과 의지할 진정한 친구가 없다면 인생은 무슨 소용이 있을까요? 사블린 동지의 연설은 사회주의자의 삶에서 가족의 중요한 역할을 강조합니다. 억압적인 전통에 얽매이지 않을 때, 가족에 대한 사랑은 아마도 가장 강력한 목적이 될 수 있고, 사블린 동지가 그 자신의 것, 가장 강력한 동기부여를 받은 것처럼 말입니다. 우리의 파르티잔들은 자신들만을 위해서가 아니라 그들을 사랑하는 사람들을 위해서 싸웁니다. 그리고 이 단순한 진리 속에서 우리가 결국 NKVD를 이기고 말 것입니다. 우리는 상임 간부회의 관료주의나 NKVD의 비밀주의에 대한 공포의 노예가 아니라 우리가 사랑하는 이들을 기꺼이 옹호하는 사람들입니다."

 BRY_for_the_future:0 "미래를 위해"
 BRY_for_the_future_desc:0 "혁명은 야고다가 쓰러질 때 끝나지 않을 것이며, 동지들을 실수하지 않을 것입니다. 그러나 우리는 레닌 동지와 부하린 동지가 우리 앞에서 했던 것과 같은 실수를 할 수는 없습니다. 동지, 그 실수는 혁명 이후의 뚜렷한 비전을 갖지 못하는 것입니다. 만약 우리가 지금 여기서 단 한 번의 승리로 행군하지 않는다면, 우리 앞의 사람들이 흔히 하던 것처럼 우리의 길을 잃게 될 것입니다. 아주 천천히, 새 연방의 뿌리는 조심스럽게, 천천히, 결단력으로 가득 차기 시작합니다. 사블린 동지는 독재자도 왕도 아닙니다. 우리는 그를 두려워하지 않습니다. 우리는 그의 노예가 아닙니다. 아니, 우리는 그가 상징하는 것을 믿기 때문에 그를 따릅니다. 우리의 집단적인 희망과 결단이 소비에트 불사조의 불길에 불을 붙이는 부싯깃이 될 것입니다."

 BRY_broadcast_the_message:0 "전언을 방송해라"
 BRY_broadcast_the_message_desc:0 "부랴티야 ASSR의 가장 큰 장점 중 하나는 부랴트 지형에 흩어져 있는 라디오 타워인데, 이 라디오 타워는 우리가 대중과 적에게 혁명을 알릴 수 있는 도구입니다..\n우리의 두 번째 가장 위대한 무기는 사블린 동지 자신입니다. 열정적이고 열정적인 그의 연설로, 아무도 우리가 정의롭고 공정한 대의를 위해 싸우고 있다는 것을 부정할 수 없을 것입니다. 사블린 동지는 인민들에게 밤마다 라디오 연설을 하여 싸움에 대한 정보를 계속 전달하고 그 주위에서 대의명분을 규합할 것입니다. 이 강력한 도구로 우리는 모두가 혁명의 편에 설 수 있도록 보장할 것입니다."

 BRY_nothing_to_lose:0 "잃을 것은 사슬 뿐"
 BRY_nothing_to_lose_desc:0 "동지들, 우리의 의로운 투쟁에 동참하십시오! 어떤 인간도 노예가 아닌 세상, 잔인한 채찍이나 총알의 대상이 되지 않는 세상, 민주주의와 노동자가 먼저 오는 세상을 꿈꿉시다! 우리는 이 세상을 현실로 만들 수 있습니다, 동지들, 우리에게 필요한 것은 여러분의 힘과 분노와 희망입니다. 동지들, 우리와 함께해 주십시오. 우리는 함께 조국을 혼란에서 구하여 평화와 번영의 새 시대를 열겠습니다!"

 BRY_of_equality:0 "평등의 불꽃"
 BRY_of_equality_desc:0 "그들의 자유를 위해 싸우는 것은 부랴트 ASSR의 남성들만이 아닙니다, 동지들. 혁명의 용감한 모든 아들과 딸들은 위대한 사회주의 건축가들이 원하는 대로 폭군들에 대항하는 이 투쟁에서 함께 싸웁니다. 팔짱을 끼고 일하는 남녀들은 야고다의 잔인한 시선으로부터 해방될 것입니다. 우리 임시 군대의 여성들은 현재 간호사와 스카우트에 제한되어 있는 반면, 사블린 동지는 이러한 정책들의 개혁을 추진하기 시작했습니다. 모든 남녀가 부랴티아를 해방시키기 위해 자기 몫을 할 것입니다."

 BRY_the_dreams_of_those_before:0 "지난 날의 꿈들"
 BRY_the_dreams_of_those_before_desc:0 "10월 혁명의 잊혀져 보이는 측면은 여성의 권리에 대한 강한 집중력입니다. 레닌이 새로운 볼셰비키 러시아를 논의할 때 썼듯이, "우리는 여성들을 사회적 경제, 입법, 정부로 끌어들이고 있습니다." 우리는 그의 예를 따라야 합니다.현재로써는, 여성들은 군대에서 남성들 옆에서 복무하고 있습니다. 비록 최전방 뒤에는 여전히 다른 나라들과 같은 억압적인 전통에 숨이 막히지만, 사블린 동지가 보길 바라는 무언가가 있습니다. 이를 위해 여성들에게 ASSR의 전시경제에서 보다 큰 역할을 신속하게 부여하기 위한 사회프로그램이 만들어질 것이며, 사블린 동지는 밤낮으로 내각과 함께 더 정교한 사회개혁 방안을 마련하기 위해 일합니다. ASSR은 편협함과 전통의 등불이 아니라 영광스러운 진보의 등불이 될 것입니다."

 BRY_and_the_will_of_us_today:0 "그리고 오늘의 우리의 의지"
 BRY_and_the_will_of_us_today_desc:0 "적어도 지금으로서는 여성의 사회적 지위에 관한 개혁을 마칠 때가 왔습니다. 사블린 동지는 전시 조치로서, 여성이 본질적으로 남성들과 동등하게 취급되어야 한다고 선언했는데, 여기에는 업무 방법, 법률, 징병 등이 포함됩니다. 이것은 다소 조각보 해결책이지만, 현재로서는 꼭 필요한 해결책입니다.우리가 이 전쟁에서 승리하려면, 우리는 모두 갑판에 손을 올려야 합니다."

 BRY_of_anger:0 "분노의 불꽃"
 BRY_of_anger_desc:0 "사블린 동지의 개혁과 꿈은 그 자체로 혁명이지만, 우리의 전쟁은 점진적이고 관용적인 개혁이 아니라 생존과 정의를 위한 쓰라린 싸움임을 잊어서는 안 됩니다.

We will begin to judge each individual member of the NKVD and determine the severity of their individual crimes. For those who are found to have committed countless crimes against the people, we will lock up and throw away the key. As for the rest, there is a chance that they can repent for their crimes in the form of community service to the people and some may yet be allowed to reintegrate.\n\nSoon the people will never have to fear the paranoid reprisals of the secret police, and together we will move ever closer to our dreams of a true revolution!"

He insists that we still need some kind of special police force to ensure our revolution's long-term survival, and that incorporating the NKVD is necessary to fill this gap. This sentiment has been echoed by the older Bolsheviks, who argue that reintegrating the NKVD in some form would be a great benefit to us. Although Comrade Sablin knows that the organization was responsible for countless atrocities and injustices, he couldn't help but see the logic in Comrade Braun's words.\n\nTherefore, it is with a heavy heart that he has decided to begin the reintegration of the NKVD into our new government. This process will include a comprehensive restructuring of the organization, as well as further trials for members that have been found guilty of committing egregious crimes against the people.\n\nTo say that this move is controversial would be an understatement, but Sablin assures the skeptics in the Soviet council that they have nothing to fear.

It would be disrespectful to those murdered to allow such a man to live, and exceedingly dangerous. According to him, Yagoda must serve as a symbol to all who would dare subvert the will of the masses to fulfill their own petty ends.\n\nHowever, Comrade Pechuro has emerged with a different approach. Believing that an execution will forever sully the moral character of the new state, Pechuro argues instead for lifetime imprisonment. According to her, the new union must rise above the barbarism of the past.

With his nation ruined, Mikhail confessed to a great many things.\n\nMikhail II - actually named Michael Andreevich, is a descendant of the Romanovs. However, we have found out that before his time in Chita, he lived in Australia, and was effectively kidnapped and sent to play the role of a king in the East. While he was put in an untenable and awful situation, he still represents a threat to Russian sovereignty.\n\nThere will be no trial for Michael Andreevich.

Konstantin Rodzaevsky and his band of thugs terrorized the Russian Far East in the name of their vicious agenda. The will of the Russian working class prevailed to defeat them, but the region is not free from fascism yet. Rodzaevsky left deep scars, and we will not have fulfilled our responsibility to humanity until they are healed.\n\nWhen Rodzaevsky's corpse lies in a ditch and we have educated the people about the evils of fascism, that is when we can rest.

The hard work of bringing these new territories into the fold is solely ours to perform.\n\nExtending our social programs into these areas will likely be popular, but we cannot predict how the people, unused to true socialism after so many years of tyranny, will respond to their newfound freedom.

There is one major enemy of the left remaining, and not one that anyone expected.\n\nWe don't know how it happened, but the preacher Alexander Men has launched his bid for the reunification of Russia. He has managed to raise a large but ramshackle army of zealots to fight for a communal, almost anarchistic, yet theocratic society in the frigid reaches of the Far East.

Even if they are misguided, we will treat them well.\n\nSoldiers will be instructed to follow strictly the laws of war and take prisoners wherever possible. They may resist, and it will certainly be difficult, but we are socialists, and we have always had to fight as hard as possible to lead the people to freedom, even when they resist.

They have benevolent intentions, but hold the belief borne of ignorance that socialists are agents of the devil here to attack their traditions. Sad as it may be, we cannot take this lying down.\n\nSoldiers will be instructed to defend themselves how they feel they must, although never to break the laws of war or common decency in doing so.

These people, although not treated badly, yearn to join their brethren at the front and will likely cause unrest if we allow them to.\n\nAlthough it may not be palatable to some in our government, the captured peasants will need to be reintegrated into the socialist system. Forced labor is not an option; exploiting their labor would make us no better than the capitalists we seek to replace. Reeducation, performed with tact and understanding, followed by some amount of government assistance will hopefully ease the ardor of Men's former conscripts."

The peasants of Siberia seem to heed every beck and call that he issues, empowered by his message of religion and reaction. This has led to Comrade Sablin himself reevaluating the nature of the role of religion in his envisioned union. Currently the general policy that we've retained regarding religion is that of secularism - the church and the state are separate, and to each man their faith, if necessary.\n\nHowever, the old union of Lenin held a strict policy of state atheism, working to eliminate the admittedly problematic influence of religion on secular life.

As such, reports are coming in that individual soldiers, platoons, and even entire battalions desecrate churches and other holy sites across Siberia.\n\nHowever, this initiative will have to be overruled. This war is in many ways fought for the heart and mind of the common man. To win them over the socialist soldier must illuminate the path to freedom for the misguided, not kick down the doors of their temples. To this end, the barbaric practices of looting and burning, unbecoming of valiant revolutionaries, will be discouraged, if needed - forcefully."

Our enemy in this war is religion itself, for, without its pervasive influence, such a disaster would never befall the lives of our people.\n\nComrade Sablin has thus long contemplated the measures we could take to oppose the influence of the Church and other institutions of religion. Suppression, both overt and covert has been rejected time after time. Ultimately, however, no alternative to it was found, as compromises and naive ideas of coexistence were set aside as well. It would seem a crackdown is the only real option we have at our disposal to rid us of further insurrection, and we have no choice but to use it.\n\nOthers will no doubt exploit this to paint our revolutionary zeal as ravings of militant atheists. Some may blame us for robbing the people of their faith and compare us to tyranny we originally fought. We must not allow these accusations to plague our thoughts. In the end, it is us who will find ourselves on the right side of history."

While some of the more radical and reactionary politicians bay for blood, the man deserves a proper trial. Comrade Sablin himself has had some conflicting feelings on what to do with the religious mystic, who has not said a single word since his arrival.\n\nIt would be unfair to kill the man, or imprison him indefinitely without a trial - after all, Father Men is no bandit king or reactionary disguised as a revolutionary. He is a man who desires the best of his people - even if his vision is fundamentally misguided and highly misinformed. Thus, he will be subject to the people's justice - and only then will we decide the fate of the Father."

We have begun what many are currently referring to as a "red spring" throughout the East, our soldiers bringing liberation and the message that a new revolution is here to stay.\n\nAs Comrade Sablin and his closest confidants continue to prepare for the liberation of all Russians, the future of the Far East and Russia in general continues to brighten, and many, for the first time in recent memory, see a ray of hope where a derelict, reactionary Union once dominated leftist political thought."

Indeed, the power of the state over all large-scale means of production, political power in the hands of the proletariat, the alliance of this proletariat with the many millions of small and very small peasants, the assured proletarian leadership of the peasantry, etc. — is this not all that is necessary to build a complete socialist society out of cooperatives, out of cooperatives alone, ...under NEP? ...It is still not the building of socialist society, but it is all that is necessary and sufficient for it." - Vladimir Lenin"

While the ministries themselves cover massive swaths of the economy, such as tourism or military production, the glavki deals with a single industrial sector, and manages it. For a while now, the glavki have been run by political appointments from on high. Comrade Sablin believes this should not be the case. The glavki must be opened to a great degree of democratization and worker input. These new glavki will be more important in civilian life as well, making the people see a direct correlation between their decisions and the impact on their lives."

Nobody is barred from the means of production, and everyone has the ability to fulfil their needs and material desires. This is the world that every socialist dreams of, and it is the world we are striving to create.\n\nUnfortunately, circumstances prevent us from establishing free association at this time. But there's nothing preventing us from getting close to that point. We will begin taking actions that will make our transition to that state easier. After all, everyone agrees getting there is difficult, and understands why we can't achieve that goal right now."

 BRY_narkomprod_desc:0 "The Union is ill. Bandits, warlords and foreign powers prowl her lands. Even our bastion is not safe from instability and catastrophe. The most visible way this manifests itself is in the food supply. Our people cry out for bread, and there is not enough available.\n\nThis is a hard choice, as we only have a limited supply of money available. We can provide relief, but it comes at a cost to our industrial investments. We could tell our people to tighten their belts and get on with the job instead, an option that hardly anyone could stomach. But we must choose, because otherwise, we won't have a plan."
 
 BRY_prodnalog:0 "Maintain Food Austerity"

One that would betray the people we are supposed to help, and one that may shake the faith of those that trusted us. But we must make it. And we have no other choice.\n\nThe economy is just too important to be derailed every time a famine breaks out. We have to regulate the food supply and institute strict rationing. We can only hope for an eventual victory to save the people of the Union. Only once we have achieved our goal can we concentrate on providing the people with food relief."

But we're socialists, damn it, and if people are starving, we get them bread! The social cost of standing by and doing nothing is far too high, and would destroy us politically. If a famine starts, we rush aid to the affected areas, with no regard for the cost. It's the right thing to do, and it's the only thing our values would have us do."

But that doesn't mean we can't tweak them a bit to make them fit.\n\nThe Red Army as we want it is a professional force, yes, but it is also backed up by numerous irregular forces in reserve.

We will also introduce new concepts to the recruits and our existing units. The implementation of armored vehicles will be a topic, as well as artillery and support battalions. Everything the old Red Army did, we will do, and moreso. Even a militiaman must understand that war isn't a test of men, it is fought with weapons as well. And these weapons can give us victory."

The least hostile and most favorable of these - though certainly still not friendly - would be the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nThe Central Committee has agreed to send a request for the OFN to invest into the Republic.

There, Sablin will proclaim the birthing of a new organization.\n\n§RThe Socialist International.§!"

Especially considering our current position.\n\nThe infrastructure laid down so long ago will be the basis of a new Siberian Plan. One that fits the needs of the working class, and not lofty dreams and quotas. One built not on the backs of political prisoners and the GULAG system, but with the full support of the working class.

 BRY.1.t:0 "The Revolution Reborn"
 BRY.1.desc:0 "As the Great Patriotic War shattered the Soviet Union, those that dwelled within the Buryat ASSR could not help but fear for the future. Even as Yagoda evacuated the government to the east, the always-looming fear of a Japanese or German strike was ever-present. Because of this, we did not complain when Yagoda expanded the NKVD's power - emergency measures, he said. We did not complain when the Presidium was purged - surely Comrade Yagoda had good intentions? Of course we did not complain when our neighbors were dragged off by men in the middle of the night, never to be seen again; surely they were traitors. When Comrade Yagoda consolidated his grip ever further, and the men came in the middle of the day, none thought any sane person would have the courage to speak out.\n\nAnd yet Comrade Sablin did. Emboldened by Yagoda's resounding defeat in the war with the Central Siberian Republic, he acted. A mere Commissar, only twenty-three years of age, but disgusted by the atrocities he had seen, he and his small amount of men stormed a radio tower, and broadcast his message for all to hear. This was not socialism, he said - this was not even a life worth living. Comrade Sablin called for those oppressed for so long by Yagoda's steel grasp to free themselves, to take a stand, to tell their oppressors "no".\n\nAnd they did. Comrade Sablin has declared the Buryat ASSR reborn, free from Yagoda's tyranny - for the moment. Even now, the NKVD march, determined to slaughter all who stand in their way. But their iron discipline and shining guns mean nothing.\n\nThanks to Comrade Sablin, we have tasted freedom, and we will die before it is taken from us."

 BRY.2.desc:0 "Without breaking his stride, Valery Mikhailovich Sablin thrust open the doors of the Verkhneudinsk Opera House, bursting through the lobby into the theatre. Chairs shoved aside, it had been transformed into the beating heart of the revolution. Sablin felt the revolutionary fervour electrifying his comrades as they filled the cavernous space with noise and motion, could see the zeal in their eyes as they saluted him.\n\nMounting the stage in a single bound, Sablin barely got time to salute the Central Committee before he was lifted off his feet in a bear hug by Mikhail Markheev, the enormous ursine Buryat who commanded the mutiny's army.\n\n"Ah, comrade!" exalted Markheev as he released Sablin, "is the energy not infectious!" Smiling bashfully, Sablin glanced over his comrades as they stood around the table in the middle of the stage. Raising one eyebrow, his right-hand woman Susanna Pechuro smiled back at him as her inseparable companion Maya Ulanovskaya frowned, irritated by the distraction. Not looking up as he scrawled over the map in front of him, the craggy old German Otto Braun grumbled, "I believe we agreed that this meeting would begin over half an hour ago, Comrade Sablin."\n\nSauntering over with Markheev, Sablin looked over the chaotic jumble of maps. Most were pre-War, and had been hastily altered to reflect the grim realities of a shattered Russia. Shrugging off a brief pang of melancholy, Sablin grinned at his friends. "Ah, comrades, the great work continues! As we free ourselves of Yagoda's oppression, so too do I shrug off the tyranny of the clock!"\n\nBraun shot Sablin a look of irritated sufferance over the rims of his spectacles. Despite his jocularity, doubt gnawed at Sablin's heart. To prevail over the tyrant Yagoda, he had to be sure they had the will of the people. "Comrades," he began, "do the people truly favour us? We cannot win this war without the common folk united under our banner."\n\nPutting down his pen, Braun looked Sablin in the eye. "In my years in China, I learned to tell what the people think of their ruler. They hate Yagoda's reign of terror." Suddenly pensive, Markheev nodded, adding, "I can say with certainty that the Buryat people are with us, comrade."\n\n"Valera, our spark has lit the flame burning in the people's hearts. They are with us and no other," said Pechuro, smiling slightly. Doubt quashed, Sablin nodded, letting his comrades get back to the down-and-dirty aspects of the revolution. The spark. He liked that."

Clustering together, they find themselves warmed by more than each other's body heat as they lean in to better hear the crackling voice spilling into their homes like the disembodied voice of God.\n\nFizzing and sputtering, that voice calls itself Comrade Valery Sablin, and it speaks of a better life. Irkutsk's peasants, long-accustomed to their lives of penury and destitution, listen to the voice with rapt attention as it proclaims the virtue of the revolution sparked by the rebels in Buryatia, of equal rights and opportunities for all, of a resurgent Russia faithful to Marx and Lenin, a new Russia where all men together could reap the rewards of the people's prosperity.\n\nThe young men who were born into a shattered Russia barely heard the rest of the speech as they sat there in the darkness with lambent eyes, mouths hanging open as they learned that there is a better way to live if only they will act, and join the revolution. Though their elders shake their heads and frown, too scarred and broken to believe in deliverance, the young of Irkutsk feel an unfamiliar burning in their hearts, like a flicker of a flame long doused.\n\nFor the first time, they feel the spark of hope."

Nevertheless, he flinched as Pechuro and Ulanovskaya swept out of a room as he passed, stopping him in his tracks.\n\n"Susanna Solomovovna, Maya Aleksandrovna. What are the ladies of my heart working on this late in the night?" he asked, his grin fading as he saw the severity of their expressions.\n\n"Valera, Maya and I have been talking," said Pechuro, "and we insist on a change of policy. We must allow women to serve on the front line if the revolution is to triumph."\n\nStonily, Ulanovskaya added, "Indeed, Comrade Sablin. Markheev complains day and night of not having enough soldiers. Women may hold a gun the same as any other, so why are we restricted to only serving as nurses?"\n\nFor a moment, Sablin was speechless. He had never believed in the old idea that a woman's place was in the home, but the frontline? "I don't know, comrades. I believe in the liberty of women, but is combat the best way for women to serve the revolution?"\n\nUlanovskaya moved closer to Sablin, fire in her eyes. "Did not Lenin and Marx before him state that the revolution could not be accomplished without women? Comrade Sablin, the women of Russia wish nothing more than to take up arms in defence of the revolution!"\n\nSablin couldn't deny that she made a good point. And they were low on soldiers. "Very well, comrades," grinned Sablin as he looked between the two women, "convene the Central Committee. If Russia's women wish to fight alongside their husbands and sons, who am I to stand in their way?""

He could not face those judging faces arrayed in the gallery, staring at him with their vindictive eyes. Ah, so this was how it ended! Twenty-eight years old, his life consumed by the chaos and madness of a shattered Russia. Trying to cling to whatever sanity he could find, he had joined the NKVD and slowly risen through its ranks in the service of Yagoda and the Presidium.\n\nRoman could not say his hands were free of blood, but neither was he one of Yagoda's slavering dogs, chomping at the bit for any chance to kill. It wasn't as though he lacked sympathy for the ideals of the mutineers either, but could a mob of young idealists truly prevail over Siberia's would-be overlords and give birth to a new Russia? No; he had remained with Yagoda, deciding that the devil you knew was better than the unknown. Gritting his teeth, Roman flayed himself for sealing his own fate. It was all over now. In a few minutes, they would drag him outside, throw him against the wall and put a bullet in his brain. He wondered if they'd even bother with a blindfold. Steeling himself, Roman blinked away his tears and looked up to hear the grim sentence he knew was coming.\n\n"Comrade Kosaryov, you are hereby sentenced to-" Roman clenched his fists- "twelve months of labour in the service of the revolution. Dismissed."\n\nStunned, Roman sat in the dock, staring motionless into the middle distance. Had he heard that correctly? Ah, he would live, he would live! Giddy with his emancipation, Roman barely felt it as a soldier gripped his arm and steered him out into the icy Siberian evening. As he smiled like a lunatic, the tears cooled on his cheeks."

That upstart bastard Sablin and his coterie of traitorous harpies had begun to put his men they'd captured on trial, accusing them of "crimes against the revolution and the people of Russia". What utter tripe! The mutineers had committed the greatest crime of all, treachery, by daring to take arms against the legitimate government of Russia in pursuit of a ridiculous impossible ideal.\n\nYagoda felt his stomach ulcer grind and pulse at the thought of that glorified child, filling his throat with the repulsive acid taste of his own bile. Worse than the fascists, the monarchists, the revisionists, the mutineers were traitors. His own men denouncing him, fighting against him. Him, the rightful heir to Bukharin!\n\nThe veins on his forehead throbbing, Yagoda tore the report apart, flinging the pieces into the fireplace.

Soldiers hugged one another, tears streaming down their faces as the reports came in- Yagoda imprisoned, the enemy fleeing west, the NKVD surrendering en masse. Sablin couldn't help but grin. Irkutsk was theirs!\n\nMarkheev stomped across the stage and thumped a crate of vodka on the table. "From my private stash! If ever we had a cause for celebration, this is it!" Snatching a bottle out of the crate, he tossed it to Sablin. Laughing with his comrades, he chugged from the bottle, splashing some on the maps heaped on the table.\n\n"Comrades!" called Sablin, drawing every eye to him. "The revolution is victorious!" he cried, waving the bottle like a baton to cacophonous cheering. "Tonight, we celebrate! My comrades, rejoice!"\n\nSitting down, Sablin looked around happily. Markheev was joking with his men, Ulanovskaya downed glass after glass of vodka, even Braun was smiling for once. Catching Pechuro's eye, Sablin shot her a smile. She grinned back at him, raising her glass in a mock salute. "We did it, Valera!" she shouted, already slurring. Sablin smirked; she'd always been a lightweight.\n\nTaking another pull, Sablin felt lighter than air. They still had a long road to go down to end Russia's chaos and bring her people into a new age of greatness, but the revolution could wait until tomorrow. Tonight, they'd paint Verkhneudinsk red."

Stopping at a water pump, Sablin washed the morning foulness out of his mouth and shuffled into the Opera House, promising himself he'd never touch vodka again.\n\nThe enormous theatre was almost empty. Rubbing his eyes, Sablin mounted the stage to greet the Central Committee. Sitting around their meeting table, his closest comrades were sipping from glasses of vodka. Markheev waved the bottle in his direction. "A bit of the hair of the dog that bit you, Comrade Sablin?" Smiling, Sablin poured himself a splash of vodka and downed it in a single gulp.\n\n"Ah! Now I'm awake. Well, shall we discuss the liberation of the east?" Sablin was unable to suppress his laughter as his comrades turned as one to glare at him blearily. He knew he ought to be as hungover as them, but he was so flush with energy after last night, when the results of the referendum to reclaim Siberia for the revolution had come in. Unsurprisingly, the people voted overwhelmingly in favour of liberating all the peoples of Russia, as they had the oppressed peasants of Irkutsk.\n\nFacedown on the table, Pechuro groaned and slowly raised her head, a map of the Far East stuck to her cheek. "Valera? Can't this wait until tomorrow? I'm not much good to the revolution with my head hammering like this."\n\nGrinning impishly, Sablin refilled everyone's glasses of vodka.

Outside, the pine trees rushed by under the light of the full moon. Gazing into the forest for a moment, Sablin opened the window and was instantly assaulted by the freezing wind and the noise of the train's passage. Lighting a cigarette, a rare luxury, he leaned against the wall of the carriage, exhaling occasionally out into the night.\n\nAfter a while, the door to the neighbouring compartment slid open. Hair tousled, Pechuro stepped into the corridor. Wordlessly, he offered her a cigarette. Waving it off, she said, "Having trouble sleeping, Valera?"\n\nSablin blew a thin stream of smoke out the window. He couldn't meet the eyes of his friend as he said, "Ah, Susanna, I should be happy. This is my wedding night. I love her, I do, but I just feel... nothing." Sablin looked up at Pechuro, tears filling his eyes. "I keep thinking, how will it end? We face the most overwhelming obstacles, and every day I send men to die bloody and horrible deaths. What gives me the right? Oh, Susanna, I have such doubts!"\n\nPechuro laid her hand lightly on Sablin's shoulder. "Nothing worth having is without its price, Valera. When you doubt, find your courage, and remember that we fight for what is true and right. We believe in you, and so does every man, woman and child in Russia who still hopes for the future. Above all else, Valera, remember the revolution, and be true to yourself."\n\nWiping his face, Sablin smiled through his tears. "Susanna, I think sometimes that you are the strongest of us all."

Letting their words wash over him, Sablin recalled that Lenin had always said women were crucial to the revolution, something many chauvinistic communists preferred to ignore. Until recently, he had given little thought to the issue, preoccupied as he was, but Pechuro and Ulanovskaya had given him a lot to think about. If they were to create a new Russia where men and women were equal in every way, shouldn't women be able to serve in combat, if they so chose? Making a decision, Sablin shot to his feet.\n\n"Comrades!" he boomed, cutting through the din. Immediately silenced, every face turned to him. "Are these attitudes towards women not reactionary? Lenin said women are as important as men in achieving the triumph of the revolution, and it is our duty to ensure they have the freedom to choose how they may serve the cause. If the women of Russia wish to hold a rifle for the revolution, let them."\n\nTaking his seat, Sablin sensed the effect his words had on his audience, like an electric current running through the air. Sitting across from him, Pechuro shot him a grin.\n\nIn a few minutes the Central Committee voted unanimously to allow women full equality in service to the revolution. Soldiers were sent running through the streets, calling the news to all, and before the day was out masses of women flooded the Opera House, demanding to be enlisted. Standing on the stage with his hands on his hips, Sablin looked down with satisfaction into the chaos of the pit. Beside him, Pechuro amiably draped her arm around his shoulder. "Ah, Valera.

One by one, they were hauled before the courts, found guilty of crimes against the revolution and the people, and dragged back to the cells. In the gallery the people howled for blood before they were silenced by the Tribunal. Watching from the bench, Sablin could not help but feel their pain; all have lost someone they love to the NKVD.\n\nAs the sun begins its descent and the last of the trials of individuals concludes, the Tribunal faces the second and arguably more important item on its agenda: what to do about the NKVD organisation as a whole. Frothing at the mouth, the more radical mutineers argue that the NKVD must be totally dissolved, for its history as a tool of statist oppression and Yagodian tyranny. Though agreeing with them on principle, Sablin also finds himself drawn to the arguments of Braun and the older Bolsheviks, who insist in quiet but firm voices that the NKVD is too valuable a tool to cast aside; that it ought to be reintegrated as a security force of the ASSR on a tight leash.\n\nSablin weighed the sins of the NKVD against its potential use to the revolution as the debate rages on. The NKVD had done so much evil, but could it be rehabilitated? Could it even be just what they needed for the revolution to prevail?\n\n"Comrade Sablin!" cried Pechuro, startling him out of his reverie, "we have not yet heard from you!

A year's hard work is nothing compared to what a less merciful adjudicator may have sentenced them to, and yet they still scowl at Sablin as they're herded onto the train.\n\nStanding on the platform with his hands on his hips, Sablin frowns right back at them. They deserved a hell of a lot worse, but if they were to birth a just and equitable Russia from the ashes of the old, they could not repeat Yagoda's mistakes. Even if the NKVD could aid in the liberation of Russia, to reintegrate them would be like selling their soul, and would deny the bloody toll they had taken on the people. So many had lost loved ones to the NKVD. Sablin refused to allow them to spill more innocent blood in his name.\n\nAs the train drew away from the platform, Sablin turned and walked away without any direction in mind. He had felt so certain he was doing the right thing when Pechuro called on him in the courthouse, but in the light of day he was not so sure. He felt like he'd been handed a sword with which he could liberate Russia and had promptly broken it over his knee. Yet it was also true that the NKVD were a force for corruption. Sablin couldn't picture himself becoming like Yagoda, but if the temptation was there, did he have the strength to resist it?\n\nWell, it was done now and he'd have to live with the consequences of his decision.

A few days of hardship had been a small price to pay for their freedom. Despite the rhetoric of Sablin's mutineers, to the men of the NKVD it seemed as though they'd simply exchanged one master for another.\n\nStaring out the window of his room into the street, Sablin wondered if he had done the right thing. Markheev and Braun had finally convinced him that it was necessary to rehabilitate the NKVD for the aid they could provide in liberating the rest of Russia, that their uses outweighed the crimes they had committed. Sablin tried to tell himself that it had not been solely his decision, all he had done was share his opinion with his comrades, but he knew he was grasping at straws. Furrowing his brow, Sablin couldn't deny that his views as nominal leader of the revolution carried an overwhelming sway.\n\nThough Sablin knew he would never use the NKVD the way that Yagoda had, it was not so easy to convince the people of that. He noticed the questioning glances his more radical comrades gave him now, the way sometimes talk would stop as he entered the room. Most of all, he couldn't forget the look of hurt betrayal on Susanna's face when he'd spoken out at the trial in favour of reintegrating the NKVD.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Sablin steadied himself. No; he hadn't the time for doubt. He had made the right decision, they needed the skill and training of these men to carry the torch of the revolution. Finally feeling ready to face the Central Committee, Sablin stomped downstairs into the street and tried to ignore the looks he got from the people who had once looked at him as their salvation."

They had decided to hold the trial in the Opera House so as many people could be packed in as possible. Braun's voice echoed in the cavernous space as he read out the list of the tyrant's crimes. Through it all Yagoda didn't so much as flinch.\n\n"Genrikh Grigoryevich Yagoda, this court of soldiers and workers finds you guilty of all the charges laid against you. Now that you are finally responsible, do you feel the slightest regret for the vile crimes you have committed against Russia and her people?" Braun looked down at Yagoda, trying his best not to look smug.\n\nYagoda turned his head fractionally to look up at Braun. When he spoke, it was as though his words were being dredged from the sediment in the depths of Lake Baikal itself. "Yes, I am sorry... I am very sorry that when I had the chance, I did not shoot you all."\n\nBraun's smirk darkened as he took his seat. "Let it be known that the accused expresses no remorse. Now, as to the matter of punishment..."\n\nWhile the court debated, Sablin stared into Yagoda's eyes and tried to make sense of what he saw there. In his time in Yagoda's service Sablin had never met the man, and had formed an image in his mind of a colossal, statuesque figure beyond simple humanity. It was easier to fight that entity than the short, haggard man who sat half-sunken in the dock. Why had he become so hollow with hate? What had led him to bathe his hands in so much blood?\n\nSablin felt a raging urge to see Yagoda extinguished, as much for the crimes he had committed as for the grim vision of what he could become if he gave into power's black temptation. And so, when Yagoda's sentence was announced- five years on a prison farm- Sablin's jaw clenched. Insufficient! That man was a tyrant, a murderer, a plunderer, an enemy to everything right and pure!\n\nConsumed by a sudden wildness, Sablin yearned to leap forward, drag Yagoda out into the mud and give him the justice he deserved."

So many had lost someone to Yagoda's reign of terror, and this was his punishment?\n\nBreathing deeply, Sablin barely noticed as the Opera House began to empty. Finally, he raised his head and slowly opened his eyes, squinting as they readjusted to the light. For the first time, he truly saw the mural that adorned the dome. It was an image of the October Revolution, of the workers storming the Winter Palace, red flags unfurled and fluttering in the wind.\n\nSlowly, Sablin calmed himself. Relaxing his shoulders, he reminded himself that this was what he was fighting for; the right for the people to make their own justice, without a tyrant to force their hand. If he had indulged his temptation to deliver the vengeance of murdered thousands upon Yagoda, it would have been an abdication of everything he stood for.\n\nFeeling a hand on his shoulder, Sablin turned his head to look into Pechuro's face. She gazed down at him with an expression of infinite compassion. "Valera, take heart. We fight for a brighter future, not to take vengeance for the cruelty of the past. By showing clemency, we demonstrate to the tyrant and all the peoples of Russia that we will never repeat his crimes. Mercy, Valera. Mercy is our greatest weapon against the enemies of all that is just."\n\nBlinking away tears, Sablin smiled. As he took one last glance at the mural, the two old friends left the Opera House, shivering in the chill evening breeze."

Swallowing to get over the crest of his emotion, Sablin pointed at a pair of guards. "You two. Take him outside." For a moment, the men did not move. Fearfully they flicked their eyes between Braun and Sablin, then, with no contradictory orders, they each grabbed Yagoda by an arm. As Sablin strode forward, the crowd before him parted silently like the Red Sea before Moses.\n\nQuashing the tiny voice within him that begged him to turn back, Sablin thrust the doors open, stalking into the howling wind. His breath steaming before him, the guards dragged Yagoda outside and dumped him in the frozen mud. Determined to maintain some shred of dignity, Yagoda pushed himself to his knees and wiped his face clean.\n\nWatching from the doorway, the crowd of Sablin's followers saw him exchange words with the defeated tyrant, but could not hear over the screaming wind. After a moment, his face as tranquil and undisturbed as the surface of Lake Baikal, Sablin pulled out his Tokarev service pistol and pumped two rounds into Yagoda's head.\n\nAs a spume of blood and brain matter sprayed from the back of his skull, Yagoda's corpse slowly sagged to the ground, crumpling as he bled into the mud.\n\nSablin stared down into the tyrant's lifeless eyes as they gazed emptily into the grey crepuscular sky. Panting with exertion, Pechuro pushed out through the crowd. Immediately, she came to a halt at what she saw. "Valera," she whispered, "what have you done? You have executed him."\n\nStill holding his pistol, Sablin sharply glanced up at her and muttered, "The tyrant has not been executed. He has been shot."\n\nHot tears streaming down her cheeks, Pechuro said, "Valera, there are songs in this world other than vengeance and despair. With those two bullets, we are doomed. Now how can anyone believe we will not repeat his tyrannies? Oh, Valera!"\n\nAs the false warmth of his hate abandoned him, Sablin fell into the icy clutches of doubt."

 BRY.17.desc:0 "Sablin sat drinking tea with Braun, Pechuro and Markheev as they listened to the report of Ulanovskaya, recently returned from her harsh journey through the taiga to visit with the long-suffering partisans of Aldan. "...very little food, Great War-era guns, constant border raids by bandits. Most of all, comrades, these people were tired. Few are under thirty, most are simply peasants who wish to return to their old lands in the desperate hope that their families are still alive."\n\n"Would they support our revolution?" asked Braun, sipping his tea as he looked over the rims of his glasses. Sablin frowned, but he had to admit, Braun was nothing if not pragmatic.\n\n"Among those who remember a time before endless chaos and privation, there are they who keep the dream of Lenin and Marx alive," replied Ulanovskaya. "After speaking with Ochirov and his council, they seemed wretchedly eager to offer control of all their land in exchange for food, protection and the right to return home. It was... moving. Comrades, these people need our help more than any other."\n\n"I agree with Comrade Ulanovskaya," said Markheev, unusually dour. "Many of the partisans are Buryats with family here. Aside from the righteousness of aiding the downtrodden, we'd gain a tactical advantage by absorbing their land, and perhaps some additional sorely-needed manpower."\n\nBraun placed down his tea-cup with an audible click. "I concur. The benefits far outweigh the potential risks, and we need any advantage we can get." Pechuro nodded her approval, looking over with an ever-so-slightly raised eyebrow at Sablin.\n\nReturning the raised eyebrow, Sablin turned to smile at Ulanovskaya. "I wholeheartedly agree with supporting the Aldan partisans. It's a favourable deal, and, besides anything else, it is our manifest duty to aid the poor and oppressed folk of Russia." Sablin raised his teacup in a mock salute. "Aldan, then the rest of Russia!""

 BRY.18.desc:0 "Sablin watched as the mist of his breath froze into tiny crystals of ice that fell, glimmering and silent, to the crisp packed snow. Native Siberians called it "the whisper of stars". Shivering alongside him despite their heavy fur coats were the rest of the Central Committee. Though it was morning, the mists rising off the forest blurred the sun, giving the impression that they were looking at everything through a frosted window.\n\nThey seemed to coalesce out of the mist, a legion of phantoms, slogging through the snow in their tattered uniforms. To Sablin's eyes, the partisans of Aldan seemed like tortured spectres of the past, once-valiant warriors who had been denied their eternal rest and now roamed the land, forever trapped in the mortal realm. They stared forward, eyes guttering and dim, carrying guns held together by little more than faith, squinting in the dawn as though unaccustomed to going about in the light of day. Sablin's heart wrenched to see their horses trudge huffing through the snow, ribs poking from their skin. In their quiet struggle, they seemed to form the image of their riders' long years of torment and deprivation. He saw the blood and sweat of painful decades lurking behind the guttering gazes of man and beast.\n\nSaluting as he appeared out of the fog, Gurzhap Ochirov rode before Sablin and dismounted. Though he was as gaunt as his men, his eyes still burned with love for freedom and the revolution. Gripping his arm in greeting, Sablin could tell that this was a man who would sooner die than give up the fight.\n\nAfter that, it was a simple matter of signing the treaty. The revolution's troops moved north into Aldan as the partisans were finally freed from their long years of penury and anguish. As they marched into the south to return to their homes and families, Sablin saw their eyes shine lambent with the long-doused light of pure, simple joy."

Walking carefully, half-afraid that the platform would collapse, Sablin approached the microphone, joining the Central Committee. After tapping the microphone twice to be sure it was working, he began.\n\n"Comrades!" he boomed over the plaza, "our revolution has triumphed over its first adversary, the despot Yagoda!" Thunderous cheers erupted from the crowd, their clouded breath forming a low layer of mist in the cold of the morning. Smiling, Sablin continued, "But our mission is not yet done! Still, Russia lies broken and divided, her corpse picked over by the Tsarists, the revisionists and the fascists! It is the manifest duty of our revolution to liberate the oppressed peoples of Russia, to build a new nation faithful to the immortal science of Marx and Lenin! We will not rest until Russia is united by the socialist revolution, from the Baltic to the Pacific!"\n\nHe was forced to pause there, as the cacophonous approval of the crowd would have drowned out anything he said. As the cheering died down, he continued, "For those who are downtrodden, we bring hope! For those who believe in a brighter future, we bring deliverance! For the enemies of the people, we bring nothing but defeat! We stand against all tyranny! Comrades, we march to the east to bring liberation, to cast down the tyrants! Long live Marx, Lenin and the socialist revolution!"\n\nGrinning from ear to ear, Sablin raised his fist, driving the crowd wild with revolutionary fervour.

In the gallery, the audience jeered and flung insults at Matkovsky. Three days of tearful interviews with the recently liberated inmates of the camps had erased any hope for clemency that the tyrant may have been holding out for.\n\nSablin watched with a smirk as Matkovsky clenched his fists and ground his teeth, staring at Braun with bulging eyes. "...for your crimes, this court sentences you to twenty years of rehabilitative labour in the service of the revolution," finished Braun. Clasping his hands, he looked down his nose at Matkovsky. "Have you anything to say?"\n\n"Yes!" spat Matkovsky, shooting to his feet to a chorus of ridicule from the gallery. "I reject the legitimacy of this so-called court! This is nothing more than a Bukharinist show trial, a travesty of justice! Under what authority do you try me?"\n\nFilled with sudden rage at the tyrant's weaselling, Sablin snatched the carpenter's hammer they were using as a gavel and slammed it against the bench, the bang erupting through the hall like a gunshot. Much to his satisfaction, the fascist flinched. Standing, and filling his voice with vitriol, Sablin said, "Tyrant Matkovsky, we try you by the authority of the workers and peasants you oppressed! Hear them, fascist! They cry out for justice!" Thrusting his arm in the direction of the gallery, he was rewarded with a cacophony of yelling and stomping from the gathered masses.\n\nAfter that, Matkovsky was dragged away, screaming threats that went ignored. Grinning ferociously, Sablin felt himself lifted up by the joy of triumph and the adulation of the crowd. The scourge of the east had been cast down by his hand. Now he could turn his gaze to the west. Soon, all of Russia would be free of tyrants and oppressors."

With a creak, Sablin swung the door open, revealing the pitiable form of Mikhail, the false Tsar. His military uniform dirtied and torn, he jerked his head to look at Sablin as he entered, his eyes sunken and fearful, his face covered by a week's worth of scraggly beard. Sablin's face screwed up in disgust; he stank. Had the soldiers not allowed him to wash? They were better than this. "Mikhail Andreevich, do you know who I am?" Mikhail nodded pathetically. Sablin continued, "I am sorry for the state of your conditions. I will arrange for this to be remedied immediately. I-"\n\nBefore he could get any further, the false Tsar lurched from his bench to grovel on his knees. Sablin took an involuntary step back as he was assaulted by the reek of Mikhail's breath. "Sablin, Comrade Sablin, I beg of you! I have been saying over and over I was nothing more than a pawn of the hardliners! Comrade Sablin, please, I beg you, you must believe me!"\n\nSuddenly, he floundered forward, grabbing Sablin's legs as he began to noisily weep, tears and snot running down his face. "Comrade Sablin, I wish only to go home! Please have mercy, I love Russia and her people, long live the socialist revolution! I beg you comrade, allow me to return home, I will never trouble you again!"\n\nSablin stared down at the false Tsar, his face contorted with a mixture of pity and disgust. It was true in part; Mikhail had been a pawn of the rightists, but hadn't he also chosen to come to Russia and claim his fallacious birthright? Though he deserved the labour camps, perhaps it would simply be kinder to let the past be past and put him on a ship bound for Australia, that distant land across the waves where an exiled prince could find a home?"

Slowly cantering between the wattle and daub huts, Sablin's clouded breath merged with that of this horse as he glanced into the empty huts. There was not a face to be seen, the villagers having fled into the hills at their approach. At last, the two comrades arrived in the centre of the village, to confirm for themselves the report of their scouts. Reigning in his horse, Sablin looked up into the face of Konstantin Rodzaevsky.\n\nThe rope around his neck creaking, Rodzaevsky swayed lifelessly. Face already beginning to bloat and turn purple, his eyes stared emptily into the overcast Siberian sky, tongue lolling between swollen lips. Sablin looked into those eyes, set into a face contorted with a final expression of black fury. To be hanged from a tree by his own subjects in a filthy village on the edge of his would-be empire seemed a fitting end for such a man as Rodzaevsky. Furrowing his brow, Sablin wondered if his life too would end in violence.\n\n"Well," said Markheev, as though he felt a need to break the silence, "so it goes. I only wish I'd gotten my hands on him first. Still, the Far East is ours now, eh, comrade?"\n\nSablin wasn't in the mood for Markheev's jocularity. Sighing, he looked over his shoulder at the soldiers. "Cut him down and bury him, comrades. I want to ride back before sunset." Turning back, he watched the would-be Vozhd slowly rotate in the evening breeze.\n\nHours later, after they'd arrived back at camp, Sablin could still see Rodzaevsky's purple, bloated face in his mind's eye. For weeks, his dreams would be haunted by the image of Rodzaevsky slowly rotating, whispering Sablin's darkest fears through his cold, cold lips as the rope spun, creaking, always creaking..."

At the head of the queue, one of the Sablinites handed out the mail that had recently arrived from Verkhneudinsk. Pimply and skinny, he was young enough to be Fyodor's son.\n\nThough he shivered in the cold, Fyodor hardly felt it. Inside he was warmed by the hope that he would finally receive word of the family he had not seen in almost a decade, since he was sent to the camps for owning books by Marx and Lenin, forcing his wife and daughter to flee into the west. The Sablinites had been good to him and the other prisoners, giving them new clothes and three meals a day, although they were still being quartered in the camp.\n\n"Your name, comrade?" asked the boy-soldier as Fyodor reached the front. Fyodor told him and was rewarded with a letter. Heart lurching into his throat, he stumbled away to a quiet place. Alone, he tore the envelope open, wrenching out the letter. It was from his daughter, Ioanna! For years he had not even known if she was alive! A dozen emotions surging in his mind like waves on a stormy beach, he began to read.\n\n"Dearest Papa, we are in Verkhneudinsk now and finally safe. How I wish I had enough paper and ink to tell you of our adventure into the west all those years past, or of the joy my heart felt when I learned that you lived! I have changed a great deal, and am no longer, I think, the girl I was when you last knew me. Above all else, I long to hold you in my arms once again. I look forward to that day more than I can say."\n\nPressing his eyelids shut to hold back his tears, Fyodor smiled, feeling the lightness of hope for the first time in years. All of a sudden the world was much larger again, and there was some small place in it for him."

 BRY.24.desc:0 "Head cocked back, Sablin gazed down through narrowed eyes at Father Alexander Men. Heavily built and impressively bearded, Men sat in the dock in his priest's vestments, his only concession to vanity a golden cruciform necklace. Breathing tranquil, he looked ahead in a state of apparent serenity, one hand resting lightly atop the other. Sablin wondered if the state of his mind was as peaceful as his exterior would lead one to believe.\n\nTruth be told, Sablin couldn't quite figure Men out. He wasn't a tyrant, an evil man. Although he seemed to believe in the best interests of the Russian people, he also fought against the socialist revolution. Having once been a member of the proscribed Catacomb Church, he had continually held that Christianity, not socialism, would be Russia's salvation. A good man at heart, but so misguided! Religion was, as Lenin had so famously said, the opiate of the masses. The Russian people would never be free until they liberated themselves from the bishops and their saccharine lies.\n\n"Alexander Vladimirovich Men-" began Braun, as Sablin noticed how Men didn't tense even the slightest as his sentence was read out, "this court of soldiers and workers finds you guilty of crimes against the socialist revolution. You are hereby sentenced to two years and six months of rehabilitative labour in the service of the revolution. Dismissed."\n\nStanding, Men silently made the sign of the cross. He went with dignity, allowing the soldiers to take him outside without resistance, not glancing back, as though afraid of being transformed into a pillar of salt. Sablin couldn't help but notice the subdued mood of the gallery; they seemed to have been hoping for more of a show.\n\nMen had been an enemy of socialism and needed to be punished, but that didn't mean they had to be cruel about it. As Pechuro had once said to him, the strength of their revolution came from their clemency, not from bloody-handed retribution."

Rolling onto his belly, Sablin drunkenly pawed for the vodka bottle, but it kept rolling away from him. That made him laugh, too.\n\nSlumping back over, Sablin gazed into the sky, watching as black night slowly gave way to the grey of pre-dawn. He smiled to himself, vaguely wondering how many bottles of vodka he'd drunk since he'd signed the treaty forming the Far Eastern Soviet Republic the night before. That was pretty much the only thing he remembered from the past twelve hours. He had no doubt he'd made quite the fool of himself during the party, but what did it matter? If ever they had cause to celebrate, this was it! Grinning like a lunatic, Sablin imagined what the party would be like when they took Moscow.\n\n"Look, comrades!" shouted Markheev, pointing to the sun as it crested over the horizon, "a red sun rises! The heavens themselves turn out for the revolution!" That got a ragged cheer from Sablin and the other half-dozing revellers, still trying to keep the party alive.\n\nStaring into the reddening sky, Sablin couldn't wipe the grin from his face. Against the most impossible odds, they had succeeded. They had cast down the tyrants, lighting the torch of the socialist revolution across the east. Despite their triumph, it wasn't over yet. They still had to bring the revolution west, into the lands of the bandits, the madmen and the oppressors.\n\nLooking around him at his closest friends, Sablin realized for the first time that he trusted them implicitly, that the strength they lent him would allow him to climb any mountain, leap any hurdle. Feeling sober all of a sudden, Sablin sat up. The party was over. He had to keep the momentum going."

Sablin was the one to carry the winds of the conversation that night, and thus he, for the blood-splattered territories of Russia and its tragic past, represented a beacon in the East.\n\n"Comrades! The Central Committee bickers often, but today, we are united!" He shouted, anticipating the newcomers even further. "Today, we are no longer the Buryatian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Today, we are something more! We will represent the liberated, and the liberators! We will show our increasing strength, and we will make a stand against the tyrant! Tonight, my friends, we will be known as the Far Eastern Soviet Republic!"\n\nCheers erupted across the entire Opera House, so loud that Sablin almost wanted to cover his ears. Markheev slammed his back with a powerful, yet friendly thump of his hand, and grinned towards him with the ever-tempting bottle. The rest - Pechuro, Ulanovskaya, and Braun, all remained content with silence. The old German merely cracked a satisfied grin, while Sablin and Pechuro exchanged awkward glances that quickly mellowed out into traded smiles. As the shouting died down, Sablin turned once again to face the Central Committee.\n\n"There is much to do, my friends. I will admit - I am somewhat afraid of the future.

Eventually, he stopped up in the middle, and sighed, turning his gaze to his comrades. "As you all know, the policy of ideological pushback in the previous Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was treating it with caution and advising party unity." His eyes swiftly moved past Susanna Pechuro, but he could see her smile before he looked to Mikhail Markheev, who raised an eyebrow and crossed his arms.\n\nIt looked like Markheev wanted to make a comment, but relented. Sablin took it as the opportunity to continue. "I say that we should explore the ways a man can think about the revolution. After all, should we not be so dogmatic as to outright deny and spit on opinions that are not exactly our own?" Markheev seemed to take in Sablin's words, but Maya Ulanovskaya cut in first, surprisingly enough.\n\n"I believe... though Lenin was right in his choice to tighten party unity, back then we still had the entirety of Russia. Nowadays, we need all we can get." Otto Braun merely snorted and shook his head.\n\n"And, what, let reactionaries slip into our ranks? I don't believe we should let any of this silliness occur. This is our revolution, comrades, and we cannot let it be tainted by the thoughts of revisionists." He shrugged. "Just my thoughts."\n\nFor once, Pechuro was silent, softly biting her thumb and looking just the slightest bit anxious. Sablin could see that, but he also had to consider what the others had said. "Comrade," Markheev began, staring intently at Sablin. "Your choice is final. You know my opinion, but we must move on, as time is of the essence."

The rest are other, various laws that were in effect in the original Soviet Union."\n\nSusanna Pechuro nodded. "I'm guessing you'll wish to reimplement this decree? What about the rest?" The other members of the Central Committee seemed to be content with silence - especially Maya Ulanovskaya, who only glanced at the papers with a slow-burning interest. Sablin set the paper down. "These other ones- the Decree on Land, the Decree on Workers' Control, and so on, we will have to readjust to fit the new revolution."\n\nMikhail Markheev looked at Sablin oddly. "Readjust? Should these not be perfectly serviceable the way they are?" Sablin merely shook his head. "No, Comrade Markheev. Though one of Lenin's first acts was to abolish private property, we have no such luxury here. It will remain - as of right now - but in due time, we will tear down all the framework of the capitalist institution." Markheev eyed Sablin warily, and the former commissar smiled.

Sablin began to frown as he stared at the tables, graphs and reports contained therein.\n\n'Unfortunately economic growth in the last fiscal year was slower than we expected,' Maya Ulanovskaya, the Minister of Economics said, 'we attribute this to a downturn in foreign trade.'\n\n'What does this mean?' Sablin replied, 'Is there still funding available for the workers' council expansion plan?' Sablin had become particularly interested in a proposed campaign to give increased control of economic planning to the local workers' councils as opposed to the bureaucracy, and often talked about the possibility of implementing it in the previous months.\n\n'Comrade Sablin, we can begin that project of yours, but for the foreseeable future it will require that we focus on them exclusively at the expense of other vital planning bodies,' Ulanovskaya's assistant, a bearded man in his forties, said, 'bodies like the National Munitions Bureau that our national defense depends on. What will it be?'\n\nA silence fell across the conference room as the Central Committee stared at Sablin, who looked at the report in his hands, and waited for his answer as he pondered that classic question of economics. After what felt like eternity, Sablin looked at the Committee once more, ready to give his orders. "

His time as a military officer was brief, but never before had he seen such undisciplined rabble. Many soldiers straggled behind in the obstacle course, creating jams or simply collapsing out of exhaustion. Perhaps a leader in the past (and indeed, many in the present) would brutalise the men into formation, beating and tormenting them until they acted like the perfect machines they wanted them to be. But Sablin was not that leader.\n\nHe walked up to the commander of the battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Novikov, who saluted him as he passed by.\n\n"No need for that, comrade," Sablin began, "I just need to ask: what's wrong with the unit? I thought we implemented measures to improve the soldiers' discipline?"\n\n"Measures, measures, measures," Novikov sighed, lighting up a cigarette before speaking, "you can't run if you're boots are worn out, you can't shoot if you don't have guns, and you can't train on what stuff you've got if they just keep wearing out. Know what I'm saying, comrade?"\n\nSablin nodded, as he made a mental note to visit the People's Commissar of Defense once inspection was done."

He smiled as he turned to Lieutenant Colonel Novikov.\n\n"I must admit, comrade commander, your new logistical program has worked wonders on the unit," the officer said.\n\nSablin smiled.\n\n"The soldiers in the Red Army are just another kind of worker, but instead of creating value they protect that value from the bourgeois thievery.

Sablin asked, looking at the United States.\n\n'America...' Braun muttered, 'following their defeat by Japan, it appears that the public is losing faith in the bourgeois capitalist order, with their opponents forming the Nartional Progressive Party against the unified liberal Republican-Democratic Party.'\n\nSablin smiled.\n\n'I assume there are many socialists in this party, then? Perhaps we can send our greetings to them?'\n\nBraun was not so enthused.\n\n'Unfortunately, while it appears that there are a good number of socialists in the NPP, there are equally large numbers of reactionaries and fascists who oppose liberalism for not going far enough.

And to see for yourselves the progress and reconstruction of Eatern Siberia under socialism.\n\nInternational awareness is important for the cause of socialism. For too long, we have wandered around, uncoordinated, aimless, blind to issues outside our own countries. But the struggle of the workers is an international one! The oppressors of the world, from the megacorporations of North America and Europe, to the dictators of South America and Africa, and the warlords and aristocrats of Asia, all put aside their supposed differences to suppress movements of the working class in their own countries. We must have a means of defending ourselves!\n\nComrades! The time has come to cast off the blinders of nationalism, and to awaken to the world around us! To coordinate, and to plan the revolution of the working class with parties and organizations around the world. To stand together against the enemies of working people.

The town, however, still suffers from the lingering effects of warlordism and neglect brought on by the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe armed forces of the Socialist Republic are more impressive. They still seem to be a group of militias, but these militias are more organized and trained than the communal defense squads we expected to find in Russia. They have uniforms, proper equipment, and an organizational structure modeled after the former Red Army. Their fighting spirit is by far their greatest attribute, and they are highly motivated to defend their homes and one day bring the revolution to the rest of the former union.\n\nFinally, there is General Secretary Sablin himself. A former commissar in his late twenties, he scarcely seems like the man to bring about the worldwide revolution. In many ways, he is not. Comrade Sablin is still inexperienced, and he oftentimes has views on the revolution that one may classify as hopeful or naive. But regardless, he has amassed a massive following amongst the people of Russia.

Unfortunately, it and the Second International were torn apart by internal strife and dysfunction. The Third International, arguably the most successful, was founded by Vladimir Lenin and headed by the Soviet Union. Sablin, a major fan of Lenin, has seen fit to follow in his predecessors footsteps and create a new Communist International.\n\nSablin promises this organisation will not simply be a group of political parties following the Soviet Union, as some have criticized the Third International for. He wants it to be a group of nations. These nations will not only provide political support to one another, but they will share industrial aid as well. One day, he hopes the socialist nations of the world will be a bloc powerful enough to counterbalance the Pact, Sphere, and OFN.\n\nOn the surface, this claim seems laughable. But...there is some interest in the other attendees. And there are some benefits to greater international cooperation with similarly-aligned states. The Russians won't let us leave without an answer anyway. So do we join, or not? We can also lend our services as an observational member if we believe a full commitment isn't worth it at this time."

She sat on her knees as she awaited the announcement from Comrade Sablin, every slight move met with an irritating creak from the loose, busted floorboards. The statement was set for about 4:00 PM, and Sofia had sat around her home watching her clock like a hawk up until the very last minute.\n\nNow she listened as Sablin's words began to take form. Steeped in static and with wavering volume, the speech still felt clear as day to Sofia.\n\n"Good afternoon, Comrades. Many of my advisors and I have realized that, although we have striven for equality both at home and in the workplace, there is still a group among us that could not rightly be called free or equal. Today, let it be known that the women of Buryatia and Russia at large will be considered equal in the eyes of their male comrades, for how can we call ourselves revolutionaries if we still leave our Russian sisters in their shackles?"\n\nSofia shot to her feet, the floorboards squealing at the sudden movement, as thoughts ran wild through her mind. However, childlike excitement gave way to deep worry as a new thought passed: how would they enforce this? She already knew the answer, and it saddened her. They couldn't. Pretty words mean nothing to those that won't listen.\n\n"Someday." She muttered as she, resigned to her fate, went to hang up her husband's clothes before he returned home. As she left, however, something caught her eye - a hatchet, leaning against the back door. Ever since she was a little girl, she had wanted to chop the firewood, but it was always her brother's job, they said it wasn't 'woman's work'. Then, it hit her. This announcement wasn't a mandate, it was a blank check for her own personal revolution. So, she decided, today she would do what she wanted. Sofia hefted up the axe and went to chop wood; Dmitri could do his own laundry."

Crowds had gathered around a training camp, men, women, and children all waiting in hushed, heavy silence or a low babble of conversation. The word had spread organically enough, although occasionally mentioned on the radio and in the papers. Some, resistant to change, had dreaded it while others had warily but openly welcomed this progress.\n\nToday, five soldiers would become the first women of the revolutionary warlord state to pass combat training and receive full colors and rank as official members of the army. So, this disparate throng of people stood and awaited the news. Reporters stood calmly, scratching down descriptions poetic, informative, or anything in between for their papers. Women and girls stood eagerly, afraid to voice their excitement but watching like hawks. Old men grumbled, much more candidly exchanging their discomfort with the change. All were silent, however, when five women exited the small building in full uniform.\n\nAfter moments of cautiously judging the atmosphere, the cheers and jeers erupted from the mixed crowds as the soldiers made their way to the newly christened Women's Barracks. Most were civil; a rose was tossed, but as was a stone. The women kept their resolve, and soon the day continued as any other day, with one change. Many were left pondering on both their own potential or their previous prejudices. No one could be sure what would happen next, but one thing is certain: times are changing."

Shifting his gaze back downward, he began to read the report: "On the Status of the Proletariat."\n\nA slew of various retellings of industrial accidents, worker complaints, safety hazards and calls for employment laid upon the page. Unemployment was up, accidents were down in number but up in severity, and the masses overall seemed to be suffering. Calmly sipping his coffee, Sablin scrutinized the report for ten minutes while thick, tense silence hung in the air around the ASSR officials.\n\nLastly, Sablin came to the end of the third page, a tidy little list of two options. One, a simple plan to increase regulation and improve workplace democracy. Another, pushed by Braun, was to work on increasing infrastructure, reasoning that the improvements to society would make their way down to the workers.\n\nThe General Secretary cut the silence with a concise response."

Sablin frowned, each of the men before him looked at him in disdain and refused to shake his hand. He sighed and dropped his hand back to his side, continuing;\n\n'I presume you know why I'm here? To-'\n\n'To dissolve our councils and instate your own rule? To chase us off with some NKVD thugs?'\n\n'Quite the contrary, comrades.' Sablin said, smiling slightly.

He had considered fleeing at times, leaving the foundry behind for a better life, but he knew that even if he wasn't caught, his wife and children would undoubtedly suffer either at the hands of the Vozhd's thugs, or from the family's only source of income being severed.\n\nOne might ask then why he stayed at the same job for all those long years, the Vozhd had been deposed long ago, was he not free to work wherever he pleased? Yet to Artyom, despite being the same factory under Sablin as it was under Rodzaevsky, it was an entirely new job. His working hours were shorter, his pay was better, he had easy access to healthcare and his labor was being put towards improving his city, producing steel girders for public housing. What's more, his wife was now able to work at the steel foundry alongside him, and their children would be cared for while they were at work.

Ever since he was a boy, he had wanted nothing more than to share his mother's delicious pirozhki recipe with the world. Now that she was no longer with him, now four feet underground with her beloved husband, he felt the best way he could honor her memory would be to share her delicious food with the rest of Russia.\nNearing the front of the line, he imagined the store. A sign in front, saying "Aleksei's Homemade Pirozhkis." Perhaps a young boy or two to help him work the store. Children and adults alike streaming in to get a taste of his sweet treats. Watching them leave with smiles and jam spread across their faces. It was going to be everything he dreamed of.\n\nAs he finalized the details of his business registration, he couldn't help but grin like a madman. His pastries would become famous, he dreamt, imagining the people coming from the nearby towns, and perhaps one day in a unified Motherland, all across Russia. With enough work, perhaps he would be successful enough to open another store in another town. Perhaps his son, just three years old now, would carry on his legacy and he would retire to the countryside assured his Pirozhki's would continue to serve the people of Russia...\n\nClearing out the bottom floor of his house to create a restaurant space, he saw it laid out in front of him. He could picture over there a booth, over there some chairs, a few standing tables, maybe even outdoor seating for the hot summer days. The sky was the limit.

Excitedly, he had charged too little at first, and soon found himself having to raise prices, take small loans from friends, and now business was worse than ever. Recently a man had come to him, an entrepreneurial and snappy type, dressed sharply and talking quickly. He had promised him quite a large sum of money, but not as much as he had spent on the store, in exchange for the ownership of his store. He had said no at first, but the second time the man came around he had seen no choice but to give it some more serious thought. Aleksei simply could not afford to run the store much longer.\n\nNow, the man came around a third time. However, this time he came around the block escorted by several police officers with his hands cuffed. Aleksei could not help but run out and ask some of the ones trailing behind what he had been arrested for, given his relation to the man. The police officer responded, "This man is guilty of monopolizing. He was caught trying to buy out a store around the street, and was caught when a kind old woman told us of the man's actions." \n\nAleksei was speechless. The man had been conducting illegal activity, and had tried to involve himself in it! Racing back inside, Aleksei felt a newfound burst of confidence for his business. In the following days, he worked tirelessly on banners, new recipes, and business skyrocketed. By the end of the week, he had paid back substantial amounts of his loans, and found himself laughing privately to his wife about how foolish he had been to consider selling the store. \n\nSurely enough, his pirozhkis became a favorite of the town. Any who stopped by were directed his way, and his store became a staple of the community. Selling hundreds a day, he continued to live frugally, preferring to spend his money on improving his store and helping others.

Where Yagoda would kill hundreds simply because they questioned his rule, Sablin merely imprisoned them for threatening innocent workers and gave them chances for rehabilitation.\n\nAnd look at Russia now, he thought. Where once a vast array of squabbling reactionary warlords fought amongst themselves, a workers paradise was built, where proletarians of all races no longer feared the bombs of the fascists, or gunshots of a local thug.
