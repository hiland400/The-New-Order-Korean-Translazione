### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 POLITICS_ADOLF_HITLER_DESC:0 "대독일국의 영도자이자 총리이며 19개 국가를 다스리는 의심할 여지 없는 폭군, 세계수도 게르마니아의 건축가, 독일 국방군의 최고사령관, 국가사회주의독일노동자당의 영도자, 그리고 타임지의 1938년, 1946년, 그리고 1961년의 올해의 인물인 아돌프 히틀러를 정의하기 위해서는 과연 어디부터 시작해야 할까요?\n\n오스트리아 여관 주인의 아들이라는 겸손한 시작을 한 그는 뮌헨과 빈에서 수학하였고 제1차 세계대전 당시 독일군에서 복무하며 뛰어난 공훈을 세웠습니다. 그가 혜성과 같이 나타나 정권을 잡았다는 사실은 그 누구도 부인할 수 없으며, 뮌헨 봉기와 같은 실패한 시도들은 오로지 그의 야망을 더더욱 키워주었을 뿐이었습니다. 그의 폭력과 쇼맨십의 조합은 공산주의자들과 민주주의자들을 라이히스탁에서 몰아냈으며 그를 최고의 자리에 올려놓았습니다. 그의 영도 하에서, 독일은 베르사유 조약의 족쇄를 끊었으며, 새롭고 무시무시한 군대를 육성하였고, 대서양 해안가에서 흑해에 이르기까지 전 유럽에 스바스티카가 휘날리도록 유럽의 다른 국가들을 무릎 꿇게 만들었습니다. 그의 영도 하에서 라이히는 아틀란트로파와 게르마니아 같은 불가사의를 건설하였고, 그의 감시 하에 유럽의 악질분자들은 맹렬히 절멸되었고 불길의 먹이가 되었습니다.\n\n그러나 독일 전역과 우랄과 피레네 사이의 유럽 전역의 구세주이자 지도자는, 늙었습니다. 한때 넋빠진 청중들의 이목을 좌지우지하던 그의 목소리는 이제는 단지 쉬었을 뿐이며, 차갑고 타산적인 강철의 정신은 녹슬었습니다. 그의 기억에서 미끄러져 나가는 오래 전에 죽은 이들의 얼굴에 최후의 붓놀림을 더하면서, 나의 투쟁을 집필한 손은 이제는 끊임없이 흔들리고 있습니다. 알렉산드로스와 나폴레옹 이후 세계 최고의 정복자는 이제는 늙고 노쇠한 인간입니다. 1962년, 그는 73세이며, 몇몇은 감히 그가 이 세계에 남을 날이 그리 길지 않다고 속삭이고 있습니다. 만일 영도자의 장례식이 거행된다면, 유럽 전역에 다시 한 번 전쟁의 불길이 타오르리라고, 전세계는 두려움에 떨고 있습니다."
 REICHSTAG_EMERGENCY_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "영도자께서는 비극적으로 돌아가셨으며, 라이히는 그 소식에 충격받았습니다. 그 누가 과연 그 천하무적의 인간이 죽으리라고 생각했을까요?\n\n분명히 라이히스탁은 아닐 것입니다.\n\n그의 후계자가 누가 될 것인지 영도자 각하께서 확실하게 지정하셨음에도 불구하고, 정부의 많은 이들은 무기를 들었습니다. 개혁주의자들, 보수주의자들, 강경주의자들, 그리고 광신주의자들은 서로 맹렬히 싸우고 있습니다. 결과적으로, 그 어떤 파벌의 일원이 되기에는 지나치게 인기가 없는 형세관망자들과 무명의 관료들, 그리고 다른 라이히스탁 의원들은 서로 뭉쳐, 지난 30년 동안 집단적으로 무시받던 헌법에 의거하여 자신들을 새로운 영도자가 취임할 때까지의 공식적인 중개 행정부라고 선언하였습니다.\n\n총통직의 주 경쟁자들은 모두 이 비상회의에 매우 적은 관심을 두고 있으며 좋게 말하자면 후보 선수, 나쁘게 말하자면 불순종적인 반역자라고 보고 있습니다. 이들의 존재가 주는 가장 긍정적인 효과는 게르마니아에 안정의 그림자라도 드리우게 되었다는 것이며, 도시가 혼돈에 빠져드는 것을 막음으로서 더 적합한 지도자가 (희망적으로) 주도할 수 있게 만드는 것입니다. 그들은 로마를 대화재로부터 막아냈으나 제국의 나머지 지역들이 불길에 휩싸이는 것을 방관할 것입니다."
 POLITICS_HANS_SPIEDEL_DESC:0 "슈파이델이 국방군에서 자랑스럽게 복무한지, 그리고 조국이 그를 자랑스럽게 여긴지 오랜 시간이 지났습니다. 그는 그가 전투에서의 용맹을 증명하여 곡엽검금강석 기사십자 철십자장을 얻은 계기가 된 50년대의 서러시아 전쟁이 절정에 달할 즈음에 SS에 대항하여 일으킨 빠른 쿠데타를 일으킴으로서 내전을 간신히 막아냈고, 그는 이를 통해 처음으로 유명세에 올랐습니다. 떠오르는 별이 된 그는 추가적으로 그의 오랜 상관과 개인적인 친구인 에르빈 롬멜의 인기에 편승했고 독일에서 가장 사랑받는 인물 중 하나가 되었습니다. 이후 슈파이델은 페르디난트 쇠르너를 위시한 라이히의 많은 군국주의자들에 대항했고, 그 자신의 이익을 위하여 쇠르너가 국방군의 통제권을 얻는 것을 막으면서 그는 생애 두번째로 라이히에서의 쿠데타를 예방했습니다.\n\n여전히 슈파이델은 정치인이 아니며 커지고 있는 국방군과 정부의 유대관계에 강한 반감을 느끼고 있습니다. 라이히의 군 통수권이 그 자신을 파괴할 수 있다는 사실을 두려워한 그는 그의 의무는 언제나 국민들을 위한 것이라고 말하며 그를 라이히에 있는 수많은 파벌 중 하나로 끌어들이려는 모든 꼬드김과 매수 시도를 거부하였습니다. 슈파이델의 충성심은 곧 그가 소용돌이치는 바다 한가운데 있는 작은 섬이라는 것을 의미하며, 파도는 매일 더더욱 높아지고 있습니다."

### IDEAS ###

 to_banish_want:0 "가난의 제거"
 to_banish_want_desc:0 "보통사람의 혁명은 국가사회주의의 더 나은 세계 질서 하에서의 풍족한 생활이라는 약속를 연료로 모든 것을 찢고 또 찢으면서 과거의 타락을 소각했습니다.\n\n경제적 실패와 폐허의 10년이 뒤따랐습니다. 레벤스라움은 라이히의 자기소멸의 촉매가 된 아틀란트로파나 게르마니아와 같은 프로젝트들처럼 현실화되거나 입증되지 못했습니다. 임시방편인 동시에 인종적 멸절을 의미하는 노예제는 궁극적으로 세대 전체의 생산성과 당에 대한 충성심을 파괴하였습니다. 지나치게 비대화한 국방군의 예산을 깎으려는 국가사회주의독일노동자당의 불안정성은 오직 그 상처에 조롱만을 더할 뿐입니다. 이는 막다른 길입니다."

 the_two_principles:0 "두 개의 원칙"
 the_two_principles_desc:0 "국가사회주의독일노동자당은 참된 이념을 가진 정당이며 - 독일의 하나이자 유일한 세력이 되어야 했습니다. 이러한 원칙 하에 당은 싸웠고 승리하였으며, 그 자신은 이제 지구상에서 가장 강력한 제국의 목을 확실하게 조이게 되었습니다.\n\n1962년까지의 SS의 쿠데타 시도와 경제적 실패, 서러시아 전쟁과 국가사회주의독일노동자당의 반복된 실패는 하나이자 유일한 힘이라는 그들의 이미지를 소각했으며, 만연한 파벌주의는 '참된 이념'의 잔해마저 불태우고 있습니다. 아돌프 히틀러의 만족스러운 영도 와 독일 국민들의 엄청난 충격 하에."

 endsieg:0 "최후 승리?"
 endsieg_desc:0 "유대자본주의적 구질서에게 거둔 최후 승리인 엔드지크(Endsieg)는 수년 간의 고된 혈전 끝에 달성되었습니다. 이 승리와 함께 국가사회주의적 신질서는 라이히를 인도하는 신의 복음이 되었습니다. 달성해야 하는 운명 - 동방식민운동이라는 새로운 삶이 독일인들을 기다렸습니다.\n\n게네랄플랜 오스트는 실패했고, 독일의 유일한 합법적인 이데올로기로서의 국가사회주의독일노동자당의 이미지는 실패의 연속 속에 파괴되었습니다. 국가사회주의독일노동자당의 리더쉽과 크게 다르지 않게, 독일인들은 매우 분열되었고, 단 하나의 문제로 뭉쳐있습니다. 그들의 미래에 대한 두려움으로."

 gone_over:0 "변절"
 gone_over_desc:0 "아리아인의 명백한 운명 아래 인도되는 파도처럼, 독일 국방군은 제2차 세계대전에서 유럽 전역을 휩쓸었습니다. 운터멘쉬들은 굴종했고, 게르만족은 승천했으며, 라이히의 정당한 영토는 정복되었습니다. 한동안 그 어느 것도 전쟁의 신의 가호를 받는 독일을 멈추지 못할 것처럼 보였습니다.\n\n한때 영광스러웠던 국방군에게는 얼마 지나지 않아 구더기가 들끓기 시작했습니다. 남아있는 몇몇 현명한 이들이 아니었다면, 라이히는 서러시아 전쟁 중 붕괴되었을 것입니다. 미쳐버린 폭격 작전과 끝없는 징병 속에 국방군은 자기유지를 위해 발악하고 있습니다. 그러나 다른 방법은 없지요. 전쟁의 신은 반대편으로 가버렸습니다."

 master_of_europe:0 "유럽의 지배자"
 master_of_europe_desc:0 "독일은 베르사유의 치욕을 복수하고 우리 천년제국의 영원한 기반을 닦으며 연합군과 볼셰비키들을 꺾고 승리를 쟁취했습니다. 독일이 1950년대의 치명적인 문제들에 직면하면서 점차 힘이 약해지긴 했지만, 독일인들은 여전히 국가적 통합과 자부심의 원천으로서 우리의 위대한 승리를 떠올립니다."

 defeat_in_victory:0 "승리의 패배"
 defeat_in_victory_desc:0 "1950년대 독일 경제의 몰락은 유럽 전체를 끌어들였고 국가를 내전 직전으로 몰아갔습니다. 최악의 상황은 지나갔고 독일 경제는 천천히 회복되고 있지만, 라이히는 여전히 이 거대한 붕괴의 여파에서 신음하고 있습니다. 식민지들은 부분적으로 독립적이며, 거대 프로젝트들은 중단되어야 했고, 독일의 군사력과 산업력은 아시아와 아메리카의 라이벌들에게 추월당한지 오래입니다."

 student_protests:0 "학생 시위"
 student_protests_desc:0 "독일 대도시들의 거리는 우리 정부의 실패한 개혁, 경제 상태, 비-아리아인들의 처우와 그들이 느끼는 다른 부당함에 대항하여 싸우는 학생 시위대에 의해 점거되었습니다. 여전히 지배적이지만 추락하는 독일에서 자라나 암시장에서 거래되는 미국과 이탈리아 미디어에 의해 타락한 독일의 젊은이들은 매우 양극화되고 극단화되며 불만에 차 있습니다."

 decadence_and_complacency:0 "퇴폐와 안일함"
 decadence_and_complacency_desc:0 "독일 경제는 비-아리아인인 수많은 노예계층에 전적으로 의존하며 독일인들의 대다수는 땀과 노역 없이 살도록 보장하고 있습니다. 경제적 불확실성에도 불구하고 급속히 발전하는 중산층들과 더불어 전세계에서 가장 높은 생활수준을 유지하고 있는 아리아인들은 이제 육체노동이라는 개념을 이질적으로 받아들입니다. 결과적으로 '열등한' 직업에 종사하는 것을 원치 않고 그 직업에 적합하지 않게 된 독일은 수많은 불충한 노예들에게 더더욱 의존하고 있습니다."

 overextended_luftwaffe:0 "비대한 루프트바페"
 overextended_luftwaffe_desc:0 "우랄 산맥에서 사하라 사막까지의 끊임없는 공군 작전과 정부와 협력하기를 거부하는 국가원수 헤르만 괴링의 고집의 합작으로, 본토에 위치한 공군 전력은 한심할 정도로 적습니다."
 
 the_great_crash:0 "대폭락"

 complacency:0 "안일함"

 man_on_the_moon:0 "월면에 선 인간"
 man_on_the_moon_desc:0 "독일은 모든 저항을 물리치고 우주 경쟁에서 승리하였으며, 미국과 일본이 이 경쟁을 추가적으로 연장시키려고 시도하나 독일의 이 기념비적인 승리는 결코 잊혀지지 않을 것입니다."

 modern_slavery:0 "현대적 노예제"
 modern_slavery_desc:0 "노예 조직력은 우리의 정책에 대항할 수 있는 능력을 나타내며 노예 불만도는 그들의 열망을 나타냅니다. 노예 조직력은 현재 5입니다. 노예 불만도는 현재 10입니다."

 ## Opening
 GER_a_man_on_the_moon:0 "달에 간 사람"
 GER_a_man_on_the_moon_desc:0 "수십 년의 지루한 연구와 지속적인 진보의 절정이 반복된 끝에, 독일 항공우주센터의 베르너 폰 박사는 현재까지 준비해온 가장 위대한 작업을 시작할 준비가 되어 있습니다. 그것은 바로 최초의 사람을 달에 착륙시키는 것입니다. 만약 성공한다면, 그것은 원자폭탄 이후, 제국의 가장 위대한 과학적 업적이 될 것이며, 국가사회주의에 맞서는 미국인과 일본인들을 다시 한번 놀래키게 될 것입니다. '우주 경쟁'은 이걸로 끝입니다. 하일 히틀러!"
 GER_the_enemy_of_my_enemy:0 "적의 적"
 GER_the_enemy_of_my_enemy_desc:0 "제2차 세계대전 당시 우리가 베풀어준 은혜에도 불구하고, 일본 제국과의 외교관계는 더욱 더 냉랭해졌습니다. 우리는 동양에서의 이익을 위해 우리보다 일본을 더 경멸하는 과거에 적이였던, 즉 미국과의 관계를 완만하게 할 때인것 같습니다. 우리와 반대되는 사상과 과거에도 불구하고, 관계를 개선할 수 있다면, 우리는 사무라이를 막으면서, 떠오르려는 태양을 막을 수 있을 것입니다."
 GER_the_speer_proposal:0 "슈페어의 제안"
 GER_the_speer_proposal_desc:0 "알베르트 슈페어는 경제장관으로서 대게르만국의 경제상황 문제에 관한 유일한 최고의 권위자입니다. 슈페어는 총통의 신임 아래, NSPAD내에서 상당한 영향력을 획득하여, 독일의 국내외 정책 결정에 영향을 미칠 수 있게 되었습니다. 이러한 영향력을 감안하여 슈페어는 이제 일본 제국의 영향력에 성공적으로 대항하기 위해 미국과의 무역 및 외교 관계의 새로운 정책을 제시했습니다."
 GER_ease_the_embargoes:0 "엠바고 완화"
 GER_ease_the_embargoes_desc:0 "유감스럽게도 대게르만국과 유니티 팍트 현재 미국과 그들의 자유국가기구(OFN)로부터 무역 금수 조치를 받고 있습니다. 하지만 슈페어 장관의 제안이 채택되면서, 이곳은 곧 바뀔지도 모릅니다. 슈페어의 제안에 따라, 우리는 OFN과 유니티 팍트 사이의 특정 삼품에 대한 무역 제제 완화를 위한 회담을 주선하기 위해, 미국 정부에 화해의 손길을 뻗어야 할 것입니다. 만약 우리가 우리의 시도에 성공하단면, 예상되는 무역 증가는 제국의 절박한 경제를 희망적으로 활성화시킬 것입니다."
 GER_the_almighty_dollar:0 "전능하신 달러"
 GER_the_almighty_dollar_desc:0 "국제 시장에서 미국의 달러화에 비해, 우리의 라이히스마르크가 놀라울 정도로 약세를 보이는 가운데, 슈페어 장관은 정부가 우리의 엄격한 외화정책에 대한 과감한 개혁을 단행해 줄 것을 정부에 요청했습니다. 우리 자신의 외환 보유액이 엉망이 된 상황에서 개혁과 규제 완화를 통해, 국제경제적 지위를 높이고 그 과정에서 미국과의 경제관계 개선을 촉진할 수 있기를 희망했습니다."
 GER_the_red_telephone:0 "붉은 전화기"
 GER_the_red_telephone_desc:0 "최근 독일-미국 관계에서의 '데탕트'로 인해, 우리는 어떤 일이 일어나더라도, 이러한 이득을 유지하는 것을 목표로 하는 것이 최선입니다. 양국간의 갈등과 침략의 역사를 고려할 때, 게르마니아-워싱턴 핫라인 구축은 양국 지도자 모두에게 유익할 것이며, 위기 상황에서 총통과 대통령 사이의 직접전인 의사소통을 가능하게 할 것이라고 제안되었습니다. 두 나라 사이의 직접적인 연결고리는 두 국가들 사이의 위험을 방지하고, 인류 자체의 생존을 보장하는 데 핵심이 될 수 있습니다."
 GER_intelligence_sharing:0 "정보 공유"
 GER_intelligence_sharing_desc:0 "대서양 사이 국가들과의 새로운 협력 관계를 증진시키기 위해, 이제는 다소 급진적인 첩보 네트워크를 구축할 필요가 있습니다. 독일과 미국 정보기관 모두 서로 경쟁관계에 빠져 있지만, 우리는 이를 치워두고 일본 제국에 맞서 협력 증진을 위해 노력하는 것이 최선일 것입니다. 우리는 그들의 활동에 대한 정보를 공유할 준비가 되어 있다면, 우리 둘 다 점점 더 커져가는 일본의 영향력과 효과적으로 싸울 수 있을 것입니다."
 GER_the_trojan_horse:0 "트로이 목마"
 GER_the_trojan_horse_desc:0 "전 세계적으로 독일-미국 관계의 개선이 주시되고 있는 가운데, 미국과 제국의 시민들은 모두 이 '데탕트'가 계속되고 있던 냉랭한 분위기를 따뜻한 분위기로 이어지기를 바라고 있습니다. 전 세계가 지켜보는 가운데, 우리는 이제 가장 획기적인 외교행보에 착수할 것입니다. 우리는 미국인에게 잘 알려진 알베르트 슈페어 장관을 총통을 대신하여, 미국을 국빈 방문 하도록 할 것입니다. 이제까지만 해도 상상할 수 없었던 이 분위기에 전 세계의 국가들이 시선을 집중하고 있으며, 특히 가장 주의깊게 지켜보는 국가는 분명 일본 제국 일 것입니다."
 GER_the_bormann_proposal:0 "보어만의 제안"
 GER_the_bormann_proposal_desc:0 "당수부장으로서 마르틴 보어만은 제국 내에서 큰 힘을 휘두르고 있습니다. 총통의 지지 아래, NSDAP의 확고한 지도자로 부상하여, 독일의 국내외 정책 결정에 큰 영향을 미칠 수 있었습니다. 이러한 영향력에 비추어 볼 때, 당수부장 보어만은 일본 제국의 영향에 성공적으로 대항하기 위해 미국과의 협력 증대를 위한 제안을 정부에 제출했습니다."
 GER_joint_propaganda_efforts:0 "공동 선전 노력"
 GER_joint_propaganda_efforts_desc:0 "대게르만국과 미국 사이의 계속된 선전은 일본 제국에 대행하여, 협력 및 동맹을 맺으려는 시도에 큰 해가 된다는 것이 명백해 보입니다. 따라서 미국과 독일이 일본 제국에 대한 공동 선전 작전을 시행하게 된다면, 일본의 국제적 영향력을 실추시키는 데 큰 힘이 될 것이라는 의견이 제기되었습니다. 우리가 일본에 대항하여 단결하려면 그들의 악함에 대해 전세계에 통일된 목소리를 내야하기 때문입니다."
 GER_spy_exchanges:0 "스파이 교환"
 GER_spy_exchanges_desc:0 "냉전이 시작되면서, 제국과 미국 사이의 스파이 활동과 전복 행위가 증가한 것은 당연한 것이였습니다. 우리가 이제 미국과의 '데탕트'를 더 오랫동안 지속하기 위해 노력할 때, 보어만은 공공의 노력뿐만 아니라, 배후에서 서로의 정보기관과의 관계를 증진시킬 것을 제안했습니다. 양측이 간첩죄로 억류된 수십 명의 시민들을 억류하고 있는 가운데, 우리는 그들과 거래해, 모두를 집으로 데려오기 위한 '첩보원 거래'를 제안할 때가 되었습니다."
 GER_recognize_pacific_claims:0 "태평양 영유권 인지"
 GER_recognize_pacific_claims_desc:0 "미국 정부로부터 진정한 신뢰를 얻을 수 있는 유일한 방법은 제2차 세계대전 동안 일본에 빼앗긴 태평양 지역에 대한 그들의 영유권 주장을 공식적으로 인정하는 것입니다. 공식적으로 이러한 주장을 인정함으로서, 양국간의 관계를 신속하게 개선하고, 일본에 대한 우리의 입장을 분명히 할 수 있는 길을 열어줄 것입니다."
 GER_spheres_of_influence:0 "영향권"
 GER_spheres_of_influence_desc:0 "보어만이 제안한 핵심 사항은 아직 극비사항으로 분류되어 있습니다. 우리는 우리의 새로운 대서양 친구들과의 비밀스러운 고위급 회담에서, 우리는 두 나라 사이의 공식적인 영역을 결정했습니다. 이 결정된 사항으로 두 나라 사이에 미래의 분쟁 가능성을 획기적으로 줄일 수 있을 것이고, 일본을 억제하는 데 더 큰 초점을 맞출 수 있을 것입니다. 물론, 미래에 우리가 서로의 영역을 존중하지 못할 때가 분명히 있을 것이지만, 적어도 지금은 두 나라 사이의 평화를 보장하기 위한 중요한 역할로 남아있을 것입니다."
 GER_a_stranger_in_a_strange_land:0 "낯선 땅의 낯선 사람"
 GER_a_stranger_in_a_strange_land_desc:0 "전 세계적으로 독일-미국 관계의 개선이 주시되고 있는 가운데, 미국과 제국의 시민들은 모두 이 '데탕트'가 계속되고 있던 냉랭한 분위기를 따뜻한 분위기로 이어지기를 바라고 있습니다. 전 세계가 지켜보는 가운데, 우리는 이제 가장 획기적인 외교행보에 착수할 것입니다. 우리는 이제 가장 획기적인 외교 행보에 착수할 것이며, 제국의 최고 권력자인 마르틴 보어만이 총통을 대신하여, 미국에 국빈 자격으로서 방문할 것입니다. 우리는 두 강대국 사이의 따뜻한 관계를 유지하는 데 성의를 보일 것입니다."
 GER_convene_the_reichstag:0 "라이히스탁 소집"
 GER_convene_the_reichstag_desc:0 "오늘 우리는 대게르만국 역사에 또 하나의 이정표를 세웠습니다. 1962년, 위대한 기념식인 라이히스탁의 연례 개막식은 독일 총통의 연설을 듣기 위해, 제국 외 유니티 팍트 전역에서 모인 사람들로 인해, 역대 개막식 중 가장 웅장한 행사로 기록되었습니다."
 GER_approve_the_budget:0 "예산 승인"
 GER_approve_the_budget_desc:0 "지난 10년 동안 대게르만국은 유감스럽게도 재정적인 어려움을 겪어왔지만, 이제 우리의 경제 문제는 대부분 안정되었습니다. 다만 제국을 위한 예산에 대한 재정 배분 같은 다소 단조로운 일이 남아있습니다. 총통의 1000년 예언은 고사하고, 제국이 적어도 1년은 더 살아남으려면, 반드시 해야 할 일입니다."
 GER_guide_the_party:0 "당을 이끌어라"
 GER_guide_the_party_desc:0 "대게르만국이 제국에서 진정한 정치적 안정을 유지하기 위해, 우리는 의회가 파벌주의로 분열되는 것을 용납할 수 없습니다. 따라서 (항상 그랬듯이) 우리는 의회 내의 당원들에게 라이히스탁에 상정할 사안에 대해 투표하는 방법과 수용 가능한 입장이 무엇인지에 대해 지도할 수 밖에 없습니다. 총통과 당의 의지에 의해 허가된 것 이외의 이상을 추구하는 것은 조국을 불안정하게 만들 수 있기 때문입니다."
 GER_a_bridge_too_far:0 "머나먼 다리"
 GER_a_bridge_too_far_desc:0 "조국이 수개월 동안 시위하는 젊은이들에 의해 시달려온 반면, 시위는 이제 좀처럼 통제 할 수 없게 되었습니다. 현재 독일 전역과 수도를 가로지르는 주요 다리 위주로 대규모의 시위가 지속되고 있습니다. 우리 국가에 불안정과 퇴폐를 불러오기만 하는 이 사회의 불량한 요소들에게 어떤 정책을 취해야 할지를 결정해야 할 때가 왔습니다."
 GER_a_war_of_attrition:0 "소모전"
 GER_a_war_of_attrition_desc:0 "제국의 거리를 '광신자'들의 피로 붉게 물든다면, 세상이 우리를 나쁘게 볼 수 있습니다. 우리는 학생들의 시위를 그저 '소모전'으로 대응함으로서, 젊은이들은 기다림에 지쳐 결국 그들의 기숙사로 돌아가, 조국과 총통만을 섬기는 어른들의 삶으로 변해갈 것입니다. 지금까지 그래왔고, 앞으로도 그래왔으니까요"
 GER_expand_the_orpo:0 "질서경찰 확대"
 GER_expand_the_orpo_desc:0 "우리는 시위를 진압했지만, 여전히 주의를 기울어야 한다는 큰 교훈을 얻었습니다. 불성실하고 동요해대는 젊은이들의 유혈사태와 잠재적 혁명을 피하기 위해, 인정받은 경찰력인 질서경찰(Orpo)을 확충하는 데 투자하는 것이 최선입니다. 불성실한 학생 계층에 대한 미래의 적대적 행동을 효율적이고, 효과적으로 진압하기 위해 제국의 경찰력을 더욱 확정함으로서, 우리는 미래의 안정을 보장할 수 있고, 이들에 대한 통제권을 군부나 SS에 넘겨달라는 어떠한 요구를 막을 수 있습니다."
 GER_send_in_heydrich:0 "하이드리히를 보내라"
 GER_send_in_heydrich_desc:0 "학생 시위자들이 우리의 내부 안정과 세계무대에서 제국의 존립에 매우 실질적인 위협을 가한다는 것은 우리 정부에게 분명한 사실로 다가왔고, 이들을 완전히 제거해야 한다는 것이 분명해졌습니다. 주요 도시를 점령하고, 당사를 공격하고, 질서경찰을 폭행하고, 대규모 혼란을 초래한 시위자들은 제국 전역에서 우리와 맞서는 파르티잔들과 거의 다르지 않다는 것을 증명했습니다. 그들에 대한 우리의 입장을 분명히하고, 그들의 활동을 분산시키기 위해 우리들의 전문대를 파견할 때가 왔습니다. 그것은 바로 하이드리히와 친위대 입니다."
 GER_ss_scapegoats:0 "SS 희생양"
 GER_ss_scapegoats_desc:0 "SS는 신속하고 능률적이며 잔혹함으로 시위를 분산시켰습니다. 다만, 독일 젊은이들의 피로 얼룩진 거리를 보게 되었습니다. 국내외를 비롯해 책임을 묻는 사람이 많는 상황에서, 우리는 그 책임을 SS의 어깨에 지울 수 있습니다. 조작된 서류와 강압적인 증언으로, 우리는 지나치게 열성적인 SS 장교들에게 책임을 돌릴 수 있습니다. 그 결과 정부의 알벽을 다소 완화하고, 몇몇 SS 인사들을 조기 퇴직시키게 되겠지만, 하이드리히가 이러한 움직임에 좋은 반응을 할 것 같진 않습니다."
 GER_pakt_wargames:0 "Pakt Wargames"
 GER_pakt_wargames_desc:0 "Although the Cold War is, well, cold, the threat of a 'Hot War' is not lost upon the upper echelons of the Großgermanisches Reich and thus we must be ready for armed conflict at a moment's notice. Therefore, the Pakt Wargames are our answer to keeping Europe prepared for a new, major conflict with our enemies. These military exercises are designed to be vast in its scope, with on average over one million soldiers from across the Pakt partaking in these intensive Wargames, helping strengthen the brotherhood and comradeship between the Großgermanisches Reich and her allies whilst sending a strong message to the wider world."
 GER_reinforce_the_east:0 "Reinforce The East"
 GER_reinforce_the_east_desc:0 "The East, both our greatest accomplishment and our greatest failure. We may have crushed the Soviet bear in Operation Barbarossa, but the bear bit back to forced us away from the A-A line a mere decade later. Since the disaster of the West-Russian War, our eastern Reichskommissariats, namely Moskowien, have suffered tremendously at the hands of degenerate raiders who plunge into the borders of the Reich, slaughtering settlers and pillaging their homes for what little loot they can find. It's evident to the Führer that the East at this time is the area of greatest strategic importance to the Reich, and must be strengthened against continued Russian aggression."
 GER_refocus_the_bombings:0 "Refocus The Bombings"
 GER_refocus_the_bombings_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe, for all its glory, has through sheer incompetence been left carpet bombing randomly selected Russian targets over the last decade, often of little strategic or tactical significance. Instead of continuing to waste valuable munitions on generally unimportant targets for little gain, we must force the Luftwaffe to adopt a new strategy of strategic bombings, namely against the West Russian Revolutionary Front. By refocusing our airpower to more suitable targets, we may yet move toward permanently entrenching our as of yet uncertain position in the East."
 GER_the_kasche_question:0 "The Kasche Question"
 GER_the_kasche_question_desc:0 "Reichskommissariat Moskowien's notoriously 'liberal' and apathetic Reichskommissar, Siegfried Kasche, has long been a thorn in our side. Seemingly having given up on attempting to enforce Germanization quotas and allowing degenerate Slavic natives to enter into Moskowien's government on an unprecedented scale, disturbing the Aryan purity of the regime, any effort to secure the East cannot ignore the Kasche question. Whilst Reichskommissar Kasche does maintain a respectable level of stability in the region, casting him aside in favor of a more enthusiastic National-Socialist could allow us to reassert the authority of Germania in the region."
 GER_ss_border_guards:0 "SS Border Guards"
 GER_ss_border_guards_desc:0 "The eastern Moskowein border is without a doubt one of the most dangerous postings within the entire Reich. The terrain is vast and rough, terrible snow storms and crippling mud assaulting our divisions alongside constant attacks across the border from raiders and Soviet partisans. To be frank, conditions on the front are horrifying, and the existing border guard has proven barely capable of the task. As such, a new proposal had been put forward by elements of the Heer suggesting that the SS should take a greater role in securing the border. As our specialist anti-partisan forces, there is surely no place in the Reich they are more suited to be deployed than such an unstable region. If in doing so SS casualties happen to begin replacing those of our young German soldiers, we shall not shed any tears."
 GER_the_southern_threat:0 "The Southern Threat"
 GER_the_southern_threat_desc:0 "Southern Europe, our greatest diplomatic failure. Although German-Italian military cooperation resulted in our stunning victory over the seemingly unshakable empires of Britain and France, relations between our nation and the Kingdom of Italy have since collapsed. The traitor Mussolini stabbed our beloved Führer in the back, abandoning the Pakt and welcomed thousands of degenerate undesirables into Italy to escape us. Having since formed their Triumvirate alliance with the Iberian Union and Turkey, the situation to the south poses the primary anti-German threat on the continent. With the Soviet threat crushed in the east during the West Russian War, our focus must now become to prepare against the southern threat."
 GER_the_balkan_bulwark:0 "The Balkan Bulwark"
 GER_the_balkan_bulwark_desc:0 "Though the dastardly Italians may have stolen Croatia from our grasp, the Fatherland thankfully still holds Serbia and Bulgaria under its influence, with both nations being supportive and enthusiastic members of the Pakt. However, our interests in the Balkans must be secured beyond all measure of doubt, combatting Italian and Turkish influence in the region at every turn to ensure that the route through the Balkans remains open in the event of a war with the Triumvirate - this must be our utmost priority in the region."
 GER_expand_the_gebirgsjager:0 "Expand The Gebirgsjäger"
 GER_expand_the_gebirgsjager_desc:0 "The Gebirgsjäger, Germany's elite alpine troops, will become crucial in the event of a German-Italian conflict at our southern frontier. The harshest fighting is sure to occur through the Alps, a campaign sure to be grueling and to which our armies will be at a disadvantage throughout. In preparation for such an eventuality, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht has proposed a drastic increase in the size of our prestigious mountain elites, knowing they will prove invaluable in such a conflict."
 GER_find_their_lepidus:0 "Find Their Lepidus"
 GER_find_their_lepidus_desc:0 "Although on the surface the Triumvirate appears a united and undeniably powerful European diplomatic and military bloc, the true reality is its inner mantle is rotten to the core we are certain. Through our diplomatic and intelligence channels, it is clear to us that the Triumvirate nations all hold grievances and dissatisfactions against each other. It is only natural then that one of the three powers must feel pushed to the way-side by their larger and more influential partners. We need only pinpoint who it is, and then exploit their unhappiness to our complete advantage."
 GER_the_eternal_enigma:0 "The Eternal Enigma"
 GER_the_eternal_enigma_desc:0 "During the Second World War, Germany's top engineers developed the Enigma machine, our legendary encryption device, along with the unbroken military code which came with it. Due to its success and uncompromised status, the machine is still regularly used to this day operating across all branches of the Wehrmacht. However, the current machinery is now extremely outdated and new computing software has developed to the point to which the Enigma machine is now growing obsolete. It is therefore time to develop a new, even better Enigma to keep our secrets safe in the modern age."
 
 ##Bormann Successor
 GER_bormann:0 "The Conservative"
 GER_bormann_desc:0 "With the Führer's proclamation of Parteikanzler Martin Bormann as successor the vast majority of German citizens are hopeful of a stable future for the Reich. Herr Bormann, a staunch conservative, is by far the least controversial choice and has gained a remarkably significant amount of support from both the Party and citizenry alike, who largely believe that only through the adoption of a far more conservative ethos can the Reich and it's National Socialist idealogy survive."
 GER_present_the_alternative:0 "Present The Alternative"
 GER_present_the_alternative_desc:0 "Unlike his opponents, Parteikanzler Bormann is largely viewed as a pragmatic National-Socialist, someone who is both staunch conservative yet able to see reason, and is able to negotiate with the more reformist elements in our society rather than simply dispersing and breaking up the opposition,\n\n Herr Bormann is first and foremost a Nazi, through and through, but he is a pragmatic man. He is no fool, and is able to work with men from nearly all aspects of German society; a far cry from the other contenders…"
 GER_secure_the_party:0 "Secure The Party"

Behind all his boasting and showmanship, is Herr Göring truly fit to rule a nation?

 reich.0.t:0 "Deutschland Über Alles"
 reich.0.desc:0 "Twenty years ago, what many have named 'The Long Night', began across Europe. Firmly under a German boot, the people of Europe are united, free, and work towards their mutual prosperity under the diligent gaze of Hitler and the Reich.\n\nAt least this is what the Nazis dreamed, but the world today is far different than they hoped. While the Axis reigned victorious, the foundations of this new Empire crumbled. While initially the Nazis celebrated, reality soon struck, as their ragtag economy failed to produce the economic miracle they had hoped for, even as they drained Europe of its wealth.\n\nFour years after victory, as the Nazi's 'Final Solution' continuing to destroy Europe, the Reichsbank quietly announced that Germany would not be able to pay for the many bonds that had supported it and that all further payments would be cancelled, on order of the Führer. This brought to the world the worst economic crash in history, as the Reichstag not only ended its domestic bonds but those abroad, and the following collapse of the Reichsbank brought Germany to its knees.\n\nWhile the Reich never admitted to the crash, the Führer claiming in a fit of rage that any rumors were simply invented by not only untermensch bankers but also by subversive elements in Italy, Japan and America. The effects were immediate. The expansion of Berlin- now Germania, faced a sudden halt as the funds drained, and the Final Solution was finally stopped due to the simple fact the Nazi's could no longer afford it.\n\nThe chaos was not only economic, but political, as the Axis collapsed due to the economic and political strife, the Reichstag split as well. Fighting over how to right their sinking ship, the strongest faction proved to be Himmler and his SS, who claimed Germany had turned from its roots, and that only a drastic move back right would save it. Himmler and the SS threatened to restore order by force as rioters filled the streets. In an attempt to stop civil war, Himmler and his faction were given their own state, Burgundy, from German France, Luxemburg and Belgium,\n\nNow, the economy has stabilized, but the Reich never recovered. The Nazis have created a massive slave caste to work Germany's many rusting factories while the Germans live a life of decadence. Now, the Germans live a life of extravagance, including the youth of Germany who have fueled a growing movement based around banned literature, American rock, and Italian cinema, and clamor for rights and representation. As the world enters 1962, Germany sits racked by student protesters, and influenced by the clear deteoriation of the nation and the unstable economy, the Reichsbank, splitting from the government in the 48 Crash, have also begun to close off to German investors, bringing their business abroad."

 reich.1.desc:0 "In 1921, Nikolai Bukharin took power in the Soviet Union, winning out against rivals such as Trotsky, Rykov and Stalin, and with various failed free market economic reforms, Bukharin stunted Soviet industrialization. When the Germans inevitably invaded in the 40s, the Soviets were unable to gather a suitable response, treachery in the Red Army tearing the nation apart even as German soldiers marched victorious through Moskow and to the Urals. Bukharin dissapeared soon after, along with most of the Soviet leadership who had not been killed and without any central authority, the Union soon fell into civil war. In the west, France fell shortly to a massive German offensive, the Wehrmacht freed from worrying about the east, and soon after, Britain stood alone.\n\nWith Joseph Kennedy as the president, the United States remained isolationist and slow to mobilize, and when Henry Wallace was elected in 1940, the United States continued its isolationism until Japanese aggression finally brought America into the war in 1943. The Japanese were victorious over the unprepared American military in the west, and although American soldiers landed in Britain to assist the Allies, the Irish government eventually folded to German demands and secretly allowed German soldiers to enter. With a sudden surprise landborne invasion of Northern Ireland, and then, with the British reeling in shock, German landings into Wales and Cornwall, the British surrendered in 1945, the Scots holding out doggedly for a few months before being brutally put down by the SS.\n\nWith America alone, its naval power shattered by Japan and Germany, the war began to reach its conclusion. After the Germans unleashed an atomic bomb upon Hawaii as a show of strength, the US government capitulated, swearing neutrality in European affairs and surrendering its Pacific holdings, as well as the ports of Los Angeles and San Francisco to the Japanese."

Under Franco, the nation has continued much as it always has, putting down leftist rebels and continuing to rally around its monarchy. With both Portugal and Spain fascist and weaker than their neighbors, the two countries began to drift closer and closer until German sabre rattling caused both to form a permanent alliance and, eventually, unify.\n\nIn Italy, Mussolini and Hitler split in anger as the German-caused 48 Crash dragged Italy down with it. In a move against the Reich, the Italians began to welcome the many groups that Hitler sought to remove, and parts of Italy remain a bustling cultural hodgepodge filled with refugees from across Europe, a continuing source of strife between Germany and Italy. Now, Italo Balbo rules Italy, and he struggles to maintain Italy both as a European power and as the master of a colonial empire.\n\nJapan has grown considerably, and has begun to rise past the Reich in power and prestige. Japan has the largest population of any nation on Earth, and also the most powerful industry, but no longer maintains ties to Germany, sitting opposed to the Reich. The two now sit locked in cold war, both armed with nuclear weapons and both not powerful enough to want to risk war with the other, though warhawks in both camps openly wish for a beginning of hostilities to finally end the question of which is the strongest.\n\nMeanwhile in America, the collapse of the Democratic party in WW2 brought forth the revival of the Democrat-Republican party, who now sit opposed to the National Popular Front, a party of progressives and the remnantsremnants of the American Socialist Party that over the years has becoming increasingly influenced by National Socialist ideology and rhetoric. The NPF's takeover of old Democratic party infastructure has brought it to the national stage, and they now challenge the Democrat-Republican party for the White House. A portion of the NPF is funded by the Reich, who hopes to put the party in power and gain an ally to tip the balance against Japan. For now, however, the Democrat-Republicans maintain neutrality and an alliance of the remains of the Commonwealth, and stands opposed to both Germany and Japan, the three locked in cold war."

 reich.5.desc:0 "1962년 1월 21일 ,아직 독일이 우주경쟁에서의 그들의 승리를 자축하고 있던 때, 게르마니아는 일본 출신 개인이 총통의 집무실에 들어가 히틀러를 암살하려고 시도한 사건으로 생긴 충격으로 얼어붙었습니다. Armed with a handgun, the assassin, suspected to be a member of the Japanese Kempeitai, would have killed Hitler if one of his bodyguard's had not happened to enter the Führer's office off schedule. Hitler was shot once before the agent was killed and the Führer was briefly hospitalized before being declared stable. While he survived, news briefly leaked that he had been killed in the attempt, and the Reichstag entered crisis without a leader.\n\nMembers of the German RSD briefly locked down the city, armored cars filling the streets and roadblocks ending all traffic for the day. The situation nearly turned to disaster when separate orders were given to both forces of the Wehrmacht and units belonging to the RHSA to occupy the city and ensure peace. When both groups, as well as the RSD, ordered the others to stand down, a 36 hour standoff occurred that nearly turned to open war in the streets had Hitler not recovered and given a personal order for all military units to return to their barracks. Blood was shed regardless, as several officials belonging to various factions were assassinated in the chaos, victims of plans sprung too soon.\n\nHeinrich Himmler has denounced the chaos, claiming that the strike would have been prevented had the Reich not fallen to decadence, and ordering SS units across Burgundy to prepare to ensure peace in Germany, supposedly only if Hitler requests their assistance. The German SS, while supposedly independent from Himmler, has began voicing support for his involvement.\n\nThe incident has showed the dire need the state has for an heir to the Nazi empire, but the Reichstag sits frozen- unable to decide. Not only has this been brought to light however, but relations with Japan are now at an all time low, and although Japan has denied sending the assassin, Wehrmacht leaders have been ordered to prepare readying for the worst."

Almost a week after the Führer was shot in an attempted assassination believed to have been orchestrated by Japan, Hitler today appeared on national television. With the necessity for an appointed successor being exposed by the incident, following days of heated debate Hitler stood before the Reichstag to announce his choice.\n\nFour candidates have been speculated for days. Martin Bormann, expert politician and head of the party, is a staunch conservative and believed the most likely candidate. Also believed highly possible is the militarist Hermann Göring, the beloved uncle of the nation if Hitler is the father. Another name being put forth is Albert Speer, one of the Führer's closest friends, who has advocated for extensive reform within the Reich. Finally, some have even suggested that naming Reinhard Heydrich as his successor would allow for the hostility between Germany and the SS to finally come to an end.\n\nAfter a lengthy, sometimes incoherent speech during which the Führer spoke repeatedly about the strength of Germany, at times seeming to lose his train of thought, the Führer lifted a trembling hand and declared his chosen successor would be..."

Bormann announced in a speech to the Reichstag that he would ensure the ideals the Reich were founded on would be followed, and that he would ensure the Reich remains strong and able going into the future. This has come to mixed reaction, though moderates and conservatives in the Reich remain pleased.\n\nWhile possibly the least controversial choice, Bormann still faces large amounts of resistance from his constituents, namely Speer, Göring and Heydrich, all of which have vowed to continue petitioning for the position. The military remains divided as well, hawks in the Wehrmacht's general staff siding with Göring, and perhaps more worringly, the German SS remaining firmly divided by those loyal to the state and those loyal to Himmler, who's own candidate, Heydrich, still contests the seat.\n\nOne thing is for certain, Bormann represents the continuing status quo of the Reich, an empire characterized by its rapid decline and slow deteoriation. Perhaps his staunchest opposition comes from the very large group who believes the Reich needs radical change to survive into the future."

 reich.7.t_goering:0 "Hitler Chooses Göring"
 reich.7.d_goering:0 "With the Reichstag in crisis and the world watching, the Führer has announced today that Hermann Göring would succeed him as the leader of the Reich. An ardent supporter of Hitler's from his earliest days, Göring has received not only support from the Nazi oldguard but also much of the Wehrmacht, namely the Heer, whose leaders hope Göring will strengthen the Reich against Japan and also among the airforce, whom with Göring served under during the war. Moderates and liberals, however, have taken offense to the appointment, most wishing to find some peaceful solution to the crisis with Japan, which they fear Göring will fail to deliver. In addition, Göring has some breadth of support in the older population of the Reich, more than at least Speer and Heydrich can say.\n\nEven with this support, however, Göring remains standing on a rocky foundation. Much of the Reich has outright refused to accept the nomination, and Speer, Bormann and Heydrich have all refused to rescind their bids. Many fear war, both inside the Reich, and without. To his credit, Bormann has assured diplomats and party officials that his response will be measured and approrpriate for the situation, for the Reich's enemies abroad and for the traitors inside, but his assurances, and his dogged refusal to outright deny the possibility of another world war, has done little to calm the Reichstag or the many protesters who have seen a marked increase in participation. The Japanese reaction is perhaps most telling of all, as they have mobilized several fleets in response.\n\nThe oddest support, however, comes from Himmler, who, while not outright supporting Göring, and still pushing Heydrich as his own candidate, has called him a "Strong man, the sort that the Reich may need in these times."

While a highly controversial choice, Speer has gained the support of a large swathe of left leaning members of the Reichstag, as well as the peace faction, who wishes to avoid war with Japan at all costs. Speer has announced his hopes to bring the Reich forward into the future, and has assured the German people that he will personally ensure the ailing infastructure and failing economy is brought back from ruin. The various student protesters are hopeful that Speer will prove an adequate inroad to the future.\n\nHowever, this news has been less well received by Speer many enemies, most notably Bormann, Göring and Heydrich, all of whom still contest Speer's claim to the position. The military in particular has taken the news poorly, Wehrmacht command and various hardliners in the Reichstag wanting a strong response to Japanese aggression, which Speer seems hesitant to give. Most worrying of all, perhaps, is Himmler, who has vowed to ensure the Reich remains true to the ideals it was founded on, whether its own Führer agrees or not.\n\nInternational observers are generally hopeful Speer might bring peace to a world desperately praying for it. Despite Burgundian hostilities, support has come from the diplomats of the United States and its allies, as well as several members of the former Soviet Union. Japan, however, has, while congratulating Speer, begun taking the chance to posture anew, already testing the future Führer, and the various minor members of the German Unity-Pakt have taken the chance to begin pushing for further independence."

For the first time in the history of Nazi Germany, the Reichstag did not vote unanimously, with a quarter of the seats voting against the appointment, and almost the same number refusing to vote.\n\nHeydrich has been denounced by the other candidates, Speer, Bormann and Göring, who claim the man to be a puppet working on behalf of Himmler, and accusing him of having convinced Hitler through trickery, the three vowing to ensure Heydrich does not receieve the seat. He has, however, received support from the SS, who remains divided in its loyalty to both the state and Himmler, as well as fringe elements of the military. The citizenry, as always, is mostly ambivalent, though the student protests have begun turning into riots at the announcements, to be brutally put down by police units.\n\nHimmler has, predictably, celebrated the news, announcing that the Burgundian SS stands ready to assist their German brethren. While Burgundian-German relations soar, tensions otherwise have only become exasperated, and the international reaction is generally one of horror."

 reich.8.desc:0 "Spain continued to maintain neutrality, despite nominally joining the Axis towards the conclusion of the war. Under Franco, the nation has continued much as it always has, putting down leftist rebels and continuing to rally around its monarchy. With both Portugal and Spain fascist and weaker than their neighbors, the two countries began to drift closer and closer until German sabre rattling caused both to form a permanent alliance and, eventually, unify.\n\nIn Italy, Mussolini and Hitler split in anger as the German-caused 48 Crash dragged Italy down with it. In a move against the Reich, the Italians began to welcome the many groups that Hitler sought to remove, and parts of Italy remain a bustling cultural hodgepodge filled with refugees from across Europe, a continuing source of strife between Germany and Italy. Now, Italo Balbo rules Italy, and he struggles to maintain Italy both as a European power and as the master of a colonial empire.\n\nJapan has grown considerably, and has begun to rise past the Reich in power and prestige. Japan has the largest population of any nation on Earth, and also the most powerful industry, but no longer maintains ties to Germany, sitting opposed to the Reich. The two now sit locked in cold war, both armed with nuclear weapons and both not powerful enough to want to risk war with the other, though war hawks in both camps openly wish for a beginning of hostilities to finally end the question of which is the strongest.\n\nMeanwhile in America, the collapse of the Democratic party in WW2 brought forth the revival of the Democrat-Republican party, who now sit opposed to the National Popular Front, a party of progressives and the remnants of the American Socialist Party that over the years has becoming increasingly influenced by National Socialist ideology and rhetoric. The NPF's takeover of old Democratic party infrastructure has brought it to the national stage, and they now challenge the Democrat-Republican party for the White House. A portion of the NPF is funded by the Reich, who hopes to put the party in power and gain an ally to tip the balance against Japan. For now, however, the Democrat-Republicans maintain neutrality and an alliance of the remains of the Commonwealth, and stands opposed to both Germany and Japan, the three locked in cold war."

While the space race has been a struggle between the Reich, Japan and the USA, and while the Americans had managed to put the first man in space, the Führer was proud to announce that the German landing firmly plants the Reich as the victor in the competition, and that Köllner, who was photographed giving the characteristic Nazi salute at the flag as the Earth rose in the horizon, was the perfect example of a hero of Germany.\n\nA grand ceremony is planned in Germania to present Köllner and his fellow astronauts with the Iron Cross, and a week of celebration has been declared across the Reich.\n\nWhile terse congratulations have been sent from America and Japan, President Nixon has vowed that the United States would be the first to create a permanent mission on the moon, and Japan shortly thereafter announced it would be the first to land on Mars."

Military units have focused their attention on Germania, ensuring the capital remain under military control, but elsewhere, the pretenders to the throne of the Reich have armed themselves and fighting has broken out across Germany. Speers, Heydrich, Bormann, Goring. Nobody knows which will win, but all of the people of the nation know that dark days are ahead of them.\n\nWith Germany in collapse and anarchy in the streets, foreign powers have already begun debating what to do. The United States and Japan both have already begun looking into how best to exploit the chaos, and Iberia and Italy have quickly begun militarizing in order to carve out further influence in the chaos. The Reichskommissariats, ostensibly loyal vassals of the Reich, sit in chaos as well, their leaders debating on who to support, or whether or not it is time to begin distancing their realms from the homeland."

Speidel has declared that the military should exist to serve the Reich and her citizens, not battle against fellow Germans for power, and him and his army have announced Germania itself as a ceasefire zone in the conflict.\n\nFor now, the various sides have ignored the city, seeing little use in wasting their resources taking it, but one can only wonder how long Speidel's peace will last, before one side or another attacks."

With nearly a million students constantly marching, protesting and disrupting business, and countless others joining them, the Reich seemed completely unable to cope with the crisis.\n\nWhile many in the government demand harsh action, nobody knows what real harsh action they can take to a movement so large and so disorganized. While threats have been made against the protesters, they remain undeterred as their numbers swell, and with no central authority, there is no head for the government to cut off. With the Orpo so disorganized and with so many paramilitary groups trying to keep place, it has been a wonder the situation has yet to explode.\n\nAt least, this was the situation, until a small army of protesters began getting rowdy with a group of Orpo officers in Aachen, and a small group of riot officers decided to open up the cities armory and quell the unrest.

Only a handful of parades were prepared, mostly in Germania and the surrounding towns, kept safe under complete military lockdown, but elsewhere, the country seemed defeated. The chaos had been drawing on for a year, or ten years, or fifty years, depending on who you asked. The German people were drained.\n\nBut the mood, as it always does, found a way to become more somber. Church bells rang across the Reich as the news broke. Adolf Hitler, supreme ruler of the Fourth Reich, the most influential man of the 20th century, passed away at age 73 in the leadup to his birthday. The Führer's health had been failing for over a decade, but it seems the constant crisis of the past year was the final mark on his health.\n\nThere is a stillness across the Reich. A nervous quiet.

The long conquest against Judeo-Bolshevism he mercilessly fought. The world's powers in awe of Germany at the Olympic Games. His struggle to break the old order with blood and steel. The house of his parents where he first dreamed to end all dreams. The stream ends with one final shot of morphine.\n\nHis worn eyes open from the injection. He looks around, as if searching for something. Behind the sliver of luminance left in between the curtains he sees the Volkshalle bathed in sunlight. He stares at the dome for some time, trying to remember Deutschland, before he hears a whisper, the only voice he ever truly loved. He shifts his gaze and for a fleeting moment, she is there.

While Reinhard Heydrich, representing both himself and Heinrich Himmler who was not able to make the memorial, was not invited to give a speech, he did lead a cadre of half a hundred SS officers to lay flowers upon the base of the statue.

At the end of his speech he declared that while him and Goebbels sometimes fought, he was sure his old friend would have supported his bid for the Reichstag, and that he is surely smiling kindly upon himself.\n\nGöring's men have since paved over much of the remains of the memorial to create an airstrip."

At the news, many pointed out that no Speerian groups had been reported in the area for days, but Bormann was quick to show the Reich how dismayed he was at the destruction. Through tears he spoke of Goebbel's great bravery in the face of adversity, and how he would have wished for Bormann to ascend to the spot once held by their beloved Hitler.\n\nBormann later had the rest of the memorial razed, citing fear that it would be bastardized into a memorial for the student anarchists his men had destroyed their, and he promised the Reich that a new and greater memorial would one day be built.

Speer stated that Goebbels, his old friend, would have wanted him to ensure the worker's safety first and foremost, and that Goebbels would no doubt have not even noticed had he still been alive for he'd be too overcome with joy at Speer's victory.\n\nAfter a short conference on the matter, Speer stated that it will be rebuilt, twice as large and grand, by himself.

This proposal consisted on increasing the already bloated military budget as well as reinstating the draft for German males. Although some members of the government believe this could help in the future, this proposal has some immediate problems to it.\n\nFirst off, even though our economy is the strongest, increasing the military budget would probably put our economy under harsh pressure, as a lot of our money already goes to the military and the rest is used to keep the Reich afloat.\n\nFurthermore, reinstating the draft would mean bringing in thousands upon thousands of young German students who hold less-than-ideal opinions on the Reich and its government, potentially making them more trouble than they would be worth. \n\nSchörner is very enthusiastic about his proposal and so are some very influential people in the government, but others want to reject him, while others still believe ignoring Schörner is the best way to shut him up. What will we do?"

Hardly an easy task, seeing how he went around trying to convince every official he could meet to support his proposal and clinging onto every tiny passage of the German law in hopes that one could help him get his proposal passed. At the end, he left with his proposal unapproved, feeling disappointed and bitter that none would listen to him."

 reich_chain.2.t: "The Missing Reichsmarks"
 reich_chain.2.d: "Over the past several weeks, reports have been trickling in over certain... discrepancies in Wehrmacht equipment inventories. Requests for rifles placed by dissolved squadrons, ammunition ordered by retired officers, uniforms requisitioned for fictional soldiers, and in one case, three trucks rented by a dead man from a motor pool. These events seem completely sporadic and isolated on their own, but this is far too widespread and well-coordinated to be a series of coincidences.\n\nA cursory investigation by our accountants also found thousands - no, millions - of Reichsmarks being siphoned out of all branches of the Wehrmacht through fake operation budgets, accounting 'errors,' and every other means of cooking the books known to man. Both the Gestapo and Abwehr, in a rare moment of unity, have both verified it, and even suggested they're from the same source. One thing has become disturbingly clear: this is is military embezzlement on a scale hitherto unknown in the Heer's history.\n\nThe Führer is understandably furious at the news, and he demands that someone, anyone, be sent to investigate this and get to the bottom of it as soon as possible."

 #### SS Investigation Path
 reich_chain.3.t: "An investigation in the Wehrmacht"
 reich_chain.3.d: "An most fascinating report has come across the Reichsführer-SS's desk, one verified by both the SD and Heydrich personally as being genuine. A suspicious amount of equipment has vanished from Wehrmacht armories across Germany, and for once this has nothing to do with the Waffen-SS's military rivalries or Himmler's personal machinations. Hitler, in his infinite wisdom, has decided to trust the SS-RHSA with leading the investigation and discovering the culprit. Although it would be within our interest to leave the Wehrmacht as weak as possible, this unknown third party may prove a danger to Himmler's plans if allowed to proceed with impunity."

 reich_chain.6.d: "Despite the SS blockade, the train managed to break through and carry on towards its destination! The SS, having refused to work with the Wehrmacht on this issue, could not call on any agency to assist them in pursuing the train. Hours later, the SS, after being fought off several times, finally managed to stop the train. However, it was discovered that some time during the chase, it was emptied, with even the crew being missing. The official reports blame SS-Obersturmbannführer Hans Sommer for the SS' failure."
 reich_chain.6.a: "Damned incompetents!"

 reich_chain.7.t: "Have Sommer killed?"
 reich_chain.7.d: "Sommer's failure to stop the train has proven him incompetent and weak, unfit to live in the eyes of Burgundy. However, he can still serve as a visceral cautionary tale. Himmler is presented with the situation, and makes a decision on how to treat him..."
 reich_chain.7.a: "Have him recalled to Burgundy."
 reich_chain.7.b: "Dead men tell no tales."

 reich_chain.8.t: "Sommer is Assassinated!"
 reich_chain.8.d: "It appears that Hans Sommer, commander of the SS on the train expedition, has been killed! His body was found in an SS-RHSA barracks, shot in the head. Despite Himmler ordering Sommer to be recalled to Burgundy, it appears that the Heydrich had other plans. "
 reich_chain.8.a: "Heydrich, a traitor to Himmler?"
 reich_chain.8.b: "His orders were to bring him in alive!"

 reich_chain.9.t: "Sommer is Assassinated!"
 reich_chain.9.d: "It appears that Hans Sommer, commander of the SS on the train expedition, has been killed! His body was found in an SS-RHSA barracks, shot in the head. It is believed that the execution was carried out on Himmler's orders, with the goal of showing the 'decadent' SS-RHSA what the price of failure truly is."
 reich_chain.9.a: "Disturbing."
 reich_chain.9.b: "A job well done."

 reich_chain.10.t: "The SS is Empty-handed"
 reich_chain.10.d: "As it would seem, the SS-RHSA have ultimately failed in their mission, and were not able to locate any clues relating to the recent stockpile disappearances. Their reports from their investigations that they showed to the officials were practically barren, as if the equipment vanished into thin air. \n\nMaybe a bit too barren.\n\nA few men with sharp eyes noticed that the investigation reports were a bit too short, that some evidence was missing, that some assigned investigators didn't arrive at all, and so on. What is, however, even more alarming, is that apparently the Burgundian SS, out of all candidates, is involved!\n\nAfter bringing a few officers and soldiers to common sense,and reminding them who they should serve first and foremost, we have contracted several documents showing various orders and meeting area coordinations, all organized by Burgundy and their vile SS. After intense panic, numerous arrest orders have been given, and much more are to follow."
 reich_chain.10.a: "Traitors! Arrest them!"
 reich_chain.10.b: "Suspicious, but acceptable."

 reich_chain.11.t: "Ghosts"
 reich_chain.11.d: "As if the situation couldn't get worse, behold, as it did.  Somehow, the arrest documents on the various SS officers that were given, because of their clear disloyalty towards The Fatherland, have been leaked for all eyes to see. What, of course, wasn't stated, is that these were all rightfully deserved. Mere hours after the files were leaked, a large number of the targeted officers suddenly started to dissapear, or somehow were granted 'political immunity' because of their 'importance to the function of the government'.\n\nIt has been decided that the best outcome will be to sweep it under a rug. After all, we have cut ourselves a large chunk of embarrassment already , as it is now apparent, that we can't keep our own SS loyal."
 reich_chain.11.a: "Fine!"

 #### Feldjagerkorps Investigation Path
 reich_chain.12.t: "A Mysterious Dead End"
 reich_chain.12.d: "The government has decided to send the Feldjägerkorps to investigate this mysterious event. The Feldjägerkorps, however, have put little efforts into this investigation; taking long breaks between sessions and notoriously bringing in fake leads to the table. The agents that are working with them have reported that they have been threatened by the Feldjägerkorps when they did an important discovery to destroy this discovery. They have also said that they have heard Feldjägerkorps say not so nice comments about the Führer.\n\nThe government suspects that this behaviour has a motivation behind it whatever it might be and has decided to investigate the Feldjägerkorps themselves"
 reich_chain.12.a: "That's what they get for being lazy and violent."

 reich_chain.13.t: "The Feldjagerkorps Blame The SS!"
 reich_chain.13.d: "After the Feldjägerkorps showed improper behaviour during the investigation they were assigned to, the government has decided to open up an investigation against them.\n\nThis investigation has reached the conclusion that this behaviour was motivated by the retirement of Schultz, which many of the Wehrmacht believe was forced. Most of the members of the Feldjägerkorps have been interrogated about this and seems pretty surprised about being interrogating, some even saying they couldn't get interrogated.\n\nThose that were interrogated said that the SS was involved although they didn't said what exactly the SS was involved on. At this point this investigation has consumed more resources than it was intended to, so  something must be done to close it."
 reich_chain.13.a: "Follow The SS Lead."
 reich_chain.13.b: "Damn It! Scrap the investigation."

 reich_chain.14.t: "The SS Defies!"
 reich_chain.14.d: "After the Feldjägerkorps told us that the SS was involved in... whatever they think they are involved in, the government has started interrogating SS members that may be involved in... the thing.\n\nThe result of this interrogation round has been dissapointing to say the least. We were expecting for someone to say something that would point to the SS and finally close this damned investigation but all the officers that were interrogated said that the SS has nothing to do with this whole thing and that the Feldjagerkorps accusations are nothing but a petty revenge due to the Schulz issue."
 reich_chain.14.a: "Looks like it's a dead end."

 reich_chain.15.t: "The End Of The Feldjägerkorps Investigation"
 reich_chain.15.d: "After much deliberation, it has been decided that the investigation on the Feldjägerkorps is going to be closed. This investigation has been nothing but dead ends and misleading clues and it has consumed more resources than it was expected to. Even though many are unsatisfied by this, it is the only thing we could do if we expected to end the investigation soon and focus our efforts somewhere else."
 reich_chain.15.a: "Let's hope this is the end."

 reich_chain.16.t: "The Calm After The Storm"
 reich_chain.16.d: "Once the investigation ended some expected that the Feldjagerkorps would take matters into their own hands since it seems like they are pretty mad at the SS for what they say was the assassination of Schulz; but it looks like this wasn't the case. Even though there are still tensions between the SS and the Feldjagerkorps, it looks like they will probably fizz out with time and we won't have to deal with any more bloodshed for a while."
 reich_chain.16.a: "We just dodged a bullet."

 reich_chain.17.t: "War On The Streets"
 reich_chain.17.d: "Even though the investigation against them was closed, it looks like the Feldjagerkorps weren't satisfied with that. They have decided to take the matter into their own hands and decided to attack a group of SS officers because the Feldjagerkorps say the SS is at fault for the retirement of Schulz. This has escalated into a full-blown battle between the two that right now doesn't have a clear winner, but with the force the Feldjagerkorps are using, it looks like it won't end in a tie."
 reich_chain.17.a: "What?!"

 ### Feldjagerkrops Win the War Path
 reich_chain.18.t: "The Feldjägerkorps Win The Battle"
 reich_chain.18.d: "After a hard-fought battle between the SS and the Feldjagerkorps, the Feldjagerkorps won even with the odds against them due to the superiority of the SS. After they won, they captured every SS officer that hadn't escaped or died and rounded them up with the intention of executing them on the spot. Thankfully the OrdungPolizei arrived before the Feldjagerkorps could carry out their desires and the situation has calmed a bit."
 reich_chain.18.a: "Arrest the Feldjagerkorps!"
 reich_chain.18.b: "Let it lie like that"

 reich_chain.19.t: "The Feldjägerkorps' Arrest"
 reich_chain.19.d: "The OrdungPolizei decided to arrest the Feldjagerkorps that were in the scene. Some tried to escape while many argued that the OrPo had no authority to arrest them. At the end all of them were arrested and transported to the police station where it's been agreed they will be trialed for this situation. The SS was released and it's expected they will testify in the trial."
 reich_chain.19.a: "Let the trial begin."

 reich_chain.20.t: "·The Feldjägerkorps' Trial"
 reich_chain.20.d: "Today, the trial of the Feldjägerkorps that engaged a group of SS officers in the street was held. It wasn't easy for the judge to proceed since the Feldjägerkorps had attempted to start another battle numerous times while the SS officers were testifying. The trial has been a long one but the judge is now prepared to show his decision..."
 reich_chain.20.a: "Throw the book"
 reich_chain.20.b: "Quietly pass them through."

 reich_chain.21.t: "The Feldjägerkorps' Execution"
 reich_chain.21.d: "The judge has decided to execute the Feldjägerkorps under the charge of subversion. The SS has publicly stated that they are satisfied with this decision with the reasoning that 'it's what the Feldjägerkorps deserved.' Others are not so happy about this decision, most notably Göring, who is furious and believes that this has been a humiliation for the Wehrmacht."
 reich_chain.21.a: "So sad it had to end with blood"

 reich_chain.22.t: "The Feldjägerkorps Go To Prison"
 reich_chain.22.d: "The judge has decided to send the Feldjägerkorps to prison for an indefinate period of time. The SS is furious about this decision and has stated that they deserve no less that the death penalty for attacking a group of innocent SS officers. The Wehrmacht, on the other hand, while believing the Feldjägerkorps should have been freed, have said that they respect the decision. Those that have been punished are already on their way to prison and some think that the SS will not stand for this situation."
 reich_chain.22.a: "Welcome to prison."

 reich_chain.23.t: "Harsh Life In Prison"
 reich_chain.23.d: "It's a widespread rumour that military prisoners have it very tough, but this is only a rumour of course. Anyhow, today all of the Feldjägerkorps that were imprisoned due to their attack on SS officers were found dead in their cells. While no firm explanation has been found, there have been a large number of possible hypothesies for the cause of this event. The current hypothesis is that they all commited suicide during the lights-out period, however this would've very difficult to pull off since they were all kept far away from each other to try and prevent a situation like this. The Wehrmacht has already pressured the government to open an investigation into this event to find out the true cause of this mystery."
 reich_chain.23.a: "Investigate the deaths."

 reich_chain.24.t: "Investigation On The Suicide of the Feldjägerkorps"
 reich_chain.24.d: "After the recent mass suicide by the Feldjägerkorps in prison, an investigation was opened to identify the causes of this incident. There were almost no clues in the cells of the dead and the only lead investigators have found is the fact that most of them had died due to poisoning while a couple of them died of asphyxiation. Each of the deaths by poisoning was by a different poison while no ropes were found on the asphyxiation victims to hang themselves with. The only other clue there is the fact that some guards took the week off due to health problems and were replaced by a group sent from an SS camp, but at the time the suicides happened, records indicate that most guards were on outside patrol."
 reich_chain.24.a: "It was a coordinated suicide. The end."

 reich_chain.25.t: "A Feast For Crows"
 reich_chain.25.d: "After the Feldjägerkorps and the SS were separated and sent their way by the Ordnungspolizei, a new attack has occurred. This time a group of SS officers have attacked the Feldjägerkorps that attacked them previously in a surprise attack, killing most of them in the process. The SS has said that this is what they deserved after attacking them. Now, the Wehrmacht has been demanding in desperation that the government should take action imminently."
 reich_chain.25.a: "I mean..."

 reich_chain.26.t: "Revenge of The Fifty-Five"
 reich_chain.26.d: "It looks like the government simply wasn't fast enough, because another attack has occurred. This time, a group of off-duty Wehrmacht soldiers attacked an SS barracks and burned it to the ground, killing over a dozen SS members during the attack and in the resulting chaos. The Wehrmacht soldiers have stated that this attack was vengeance against the attack that killed around fifty-five members of the Feldjägerkorps the other day. The SS is now pressuring the government to take action against this."
 reich_chain.26.a: "This is getting out of hand"

 reich_chain.27.t: "A Civil War?"
 reich_chain.27.d: "After the so called 'Revenge of The Fifty-Five,' it looks like the SS and Wehrmacht are at each other's throats. If we don't do something soon and decisively side with one of them, more attacks could happen, and the country might be thrown into civil war. If we knew this would happen by sending the Feldjägerkorps to investigate the disappearance of money and guns, we would have probably send the SS to do it instead."
 reich_chain.27.a: "The SS is right"
 reich_chain.27.b: "The Wehrmacht is right"

 reich_chain.28.t: "Ashes"
 reich_chain.28.d: "Apparently, it is not possible for the various armed forces in the Reich to co-exist together for more than five minutes. Today has been in the spirit of murdering each other on sight.\n\nAfter the recent Wehrmacht revenge on the SS, it was clear that they wouldn't just wash it off. Gunshots could be heard today at every large military base; grenades were going off in every city; orders shouted at every corner.\n\nThis madness had to be stopped at once.\n\nIn the end, the government decided to side with the SS forces, to not agitate them further, probably. This apparant show of support has given a boost to SS efforts, as the SS turned out victorious and the Wehrmacht mutiny has been defeated. Of course, this by no means was the end of trouble for The Reichstag. Göring and the Wehrmacht as a whole are absolutely furious that the government prefers some Burgundian lapdogs over Germany's proud sons. The SS is, at least, somewhat pleased with the outcome. The aftermath is however not looking in our favour."
 reich_chain.28.a: "At least it has ended."

 reich_chain.29.t: "Ashes"
 reich_chain.29.d: "The Reich won't get a moment of rest, as it would seem. After the recent revenge of the Wehrmacht on the SS, it seems that both sides are now tired of petty raids and have escalated the conflict.\n\nFighting has broken out across the whole Reich, with the Wehrmacht and the SS attacking each others' outposts and barracks where they can. This crisis has to be stopped before it tears the Reich appart. The Reichstag has, in the end, sided with the Wehrmacht, possibly due to extensive blackmail and threats from Göring.\n\nRegardless, the Wehrmacht has emerged as the victor. What is unfortunate however, is that the consequences can already be seen. The SS are absolutely furious, stating that the Wehrmacht had absolutely no right to massacre their forces. The Wehrmacht itself have been weakened by such unsuspected larger scale conflict. And as if it wasn't enough, we ourselves have been greatly humiliated, by allowing such an event to even happen under our watch."
 reich_chain.29.a: "At least it has ended."

 ###SS Win the War Path
 reich_chain.30.t: "The SS Slaughters the Feldjägerkorps "
 reich_chain.30.d: "Germany was in shock today, as 55 members of the Feldjägerkorps attacked an SS detachment in broad daylight this morning. Relations between the two organisations have never been particularly good, but with the Feldjägers investigating the SS these past few weeks that relationship has deteriorated to a point of crisis. Agents of the Feldjägers attempted to take matters into their own hands today, and went out to arrest several members of the SS. This turned out rather poorly for the Feldjägers, who were slaughtered to the last during an intense battle with the SS. But as the dust settles, it has becomes clear that the German people, and more importantly the Feldjägers, want justice to be enforced on the SS. This would, however, greatly anger the SS. What should we do?"
 reich_chain.30.a: "Arrest the fools, justice shall be enforced!"
 reich_chain.30.b: "Best to let sleeping dogs lie, let them go."

 reich_chain.32.t: "Our men rot in a German cell"
 reich_chain.32.d: "After a squadron of Waffen-SS men were violently set upon by a group of crazed Feldjägers, the German police had the gall to arrest our men for daring to defend themselves! Many in the Wehrmacht - mostly degenerates and sycophants - are calling for the men to be court-martialed on baseless charges of treason, and it seems they're swaying the Führer with their lies. If we want to protect their lives (not to mention make sure confidential military plans stay that way), it would be most advisable to demand their immediate extradition back to the Ordenstaat to be tried by a proper SS court. However, it would risk burning the few bridges we have remaining with the reich_chain."
 reich_chain.32.a: "Our ties with Germany are worth more than a few men."
 reich_chain.32.b: "No man of the SS shall be subject to this farce of justice!"

 ##Refuse Trial Path
 reich_chain.33.t: "Burgundy demands the SS soldiers' extradition"
 reich_chain.33.d: "A scathing telegram arrived from Himmler this morning demanding that the SS soldiers who slaughtered the Feldjägers have all charges of murder downgraded to involuntary manslaughter, all charges of conspiracy or treason be dropped, and that all defendants be immediately extradited to Burgundy for a Waffen-SS court martial. This was followed by a list of veiled threats with varying degrees of subtlety.\n\nOf course, acquiescing to Himmler's demands would all but guarantee that the men responsible for the Feldjägers' murder would walk away scot-free in Burgundy, and would understandably infuriate the families and Wehrmacht superiors of the deceased. Refusing Himmler, however, is a very dangerous game to play, even for those among the most powerful in the  reich_chain..."
 reich_chain.33.a: "Why should we listen to his ravings? The trial goes on!"
 reich_chain.33.b: "Friendship with Burgundy is of the utmost importance, extradite them."

 reich_chain.34.t: "Germany agrees to our demands!"
 reich_chain.34.d:  "This morning, a train arrived in Ost-Paris, filled with the valiant SS men imprisoned for defending themselves from the Feldjäger mongrels. They were greeted by the Reichsführer-SS himself on the platform, who gave a brief speech praising their loyalty and bravery in the face of adversity and betrayal. One brief visit to a military tribunal later, and all outlandish charges of murder were quickly dismissed on blatantly obvious grounds of self-defense, and the soldiers were free men once more."
 reich_chain.34.a: "Justice has been served."

 reich_chain.35.t: "Germany refuses our demands!"
 reich_chain.35.d: "As the hours slowly passed by, Germania was silent. No telegrams, no phone calls, no notifications of diplomatic trains arriving, nothing at all. When a telegram finally did arrive from the Führer himself, it was eagerly sent to Himmler. Its contents, however, were far from what he was anticipating: Hitler was chiding Himmler for overstepping his bounds and trying to subvert the law, much like how a parent would scold a child. Göring and the other decadent and corrupt generals' words were as clear as day - they likely wrote the whole thing and simply had the Führer rubber-stamp it for a veneer of legitimacy.\n\nIt seems that politeness and civility have gotten us nowhere, and more... direct action may soon be necessary to help ensure the safety of our imprisoned men."
 reich_chain.35.a: "Well, we can say we tried."
 reich_chain.35.b: "Bring our soldiers home, by any means necessary."

 reich_chain.36.t: "Burgundy acquiesces"
 reich_chain.36.d: "It seems that our forcefulness in the face of adversity has paid off. The ranting from Burgundy seems like it has finally died down, and the trial against the Waffen-SS murderers can proceed as originally intended. Never before has the Wehrmacht high command been so relieved to hear nothing but silence from Himmler."
 reich_chain.36.a: "No news is good news, it seems."

 reich_chain.37.t: "The Waffen-SS attempts to break out their own!"
 reich_chain.37.d: "Due to concerns for their safety and fears of a potential breakout attempt, the Waffen-SS murderers are continually shuffled between various prisons around Germania under heavy guard at random hours. As the prisoners were being transferred between the Karlslust and Spandau prisons in the early hours of the morning, their convoy was blocked by a garbage truck pulling out of an alleyway. Before the convoy could reverse and follow a detour, plainclothes soldiers hiding in alleyways, buildings, and nearby cars suddenly attacked with automatic rifle fire, grenades, and even a panzerfaust. Although eight military police were killed and one of the armored cars was disabled by a grenade, the rest of the convoy narrowly escaped and sped to Spandau prison with no further interruption.\n\nWhen the Wehrmacht secured the scene of the crime, the assailants had already fled, taking their dead and wounded with them. A rifle was left behind: new, military-issue, and manufactured in Burgundy. The SS have categorically denied any involvement in this, but their failure has become common knowledge in Wehrmacht officers' circles."
 reich_chain.37.a: "That's what they get for trying to subvert German justice!"

 reich_chain.38.t: "The Waffen-SS break out their own!"
 reich_chain.38.d: "Due to concerns for their safety and fears of a potential breakout attempt, the Waffen-SS murderers are continually shuffled between various prisons around Germania under heavy guard at random hours. As the prisoners were being transferred between the Karlslust and Spandau prisons in the early hours of the morning, their convoy was blocked by a garbage truck pulling out of an alleyway. Before the convoy could reverse and follow a detour, plainclothes soldiers hiding in alleyways, buildings, and nearby cars suddenly attacked with automatic rifle fire, grenades, and even a panzerfaust. The main and rear cars were both disabled by grenades, and the prisoner transport was quickly overwhelmed by the assailants before radio contact was lost.\n\nWhen the Wehrmacht arrived to secure the scene, they found nearly two dozen Wehrmacht soldiers dead, many seemingly executed point-blank. The attackers had absconded with their wounded and dead, taking the prisoners with them. Although the SS have categorically denied any involvement in this, the Wehrmacht remain unconvinced and demand vengeance."
 reich_chain.38.a: "Damn them! We need to lick our wounds and bide our time..."
 reich_chain.38.b: "Send in the military, I want them found! NOW!"

 reich_chain.39.t: "General Hollidt is on the case!"
 reich_chain.39.d: "Personally selected by the Führer himself, Generaloberst Karl-Adolf Hollidt of the Wehrmacht has been charged with tracking down those responsible for the recent break-out of the SS prisoners with 'every means in the Reich' at his disposal. Already, he has men from the Abwehr going over every single travel itinerary, equipment order, and field report from Germania Division of the Waffen-SS with a fine-toothed comb, in hopes that he could find any information on who could have hired the agents and where they came from."
 reich_chain.39.a: "Good luck, Hollidt, we're all counting on you."

 reich_chain.40.t: "General Hollidt killed!"
 reich_chain.40.d: "As he was driving home from working on the investigation this evening, Generaloberst Karl-Adolf Hollidt was stuck by a drunk truck driver as he passed through an intersection and was pronounced dead on the spot. The truck driver was also found dead at the scene of the crash, seemingly having broken his neck when his seatbelt slipped upward during the impact. Although many within the Wehrmacht are crying foul and scramble to find a suitable replacement candidate to head up the investigation, it seems that the police are content to write this off as a tragic accident."
 reich_chain.40.a: "How incredibly convenient for the SS..."

 reich_chain.41.t: "The Bohemian Connection"
 reich_chain.41.d: "After what initially seemed like fruitlessly digging through SS headquarters' rubbish, one member of Hollidt's investigation stumbled a major lead. A receipt from a Spandau hotel's bar was found, on the tab of one (obviously pseudonymous) 'Hans Schmidt.' A squad of military police quickly went to Schmidt's room, where he immediately took a cyanide pill upon seeing the officers arriving. One of the few survivors of the convoy break-out later identified him as present at the event.\n\nAlthough Schmidt had destroyed any documents concerning his real identity or any SS connections, two papers were recovered: a train ticket to Prague, and papers granting him permission to meet with the  reichskommissar of Bohemia-Moravia, Kurt Deleuge."
 reich_chain.41.a: "It seems a holiday to Prague is in order."

 reich_chain.42.t: "The Bohemian Connection has Derailed"
 reich_chain.42.d: "After discovering the potential location of the SS terrorists' cell in Bohemia, Generaloberst Hollidt ordered a squadron of soldiers, analysts, and military police to accompany him in pursuit. However, the investigation would reach a premature end before they could ever arrive.\n\nAs their high-speed train crossed a bridge over the Vltava river en route to Prague, a support column collapsed, sending the train careening into the water. Those who survived the initial impact inevitably drowned when the heavily-armored train quickly sank to the riverbed. An investigation by the Abwehr suggested that the column was destroyed by high-density military-grade explosives, while the Gestapo claims that it was likely done by escaped Polish partisans using stolen mines. Whatever the cause, it seems that the investigation stops here."
 reich_chain.42.a: "Damnation!"

 reich_chain.46.t: "Hollidt found gruesomely murdered"
 reich_chain.46.d: "The festivities within the Wehrmacht concerning their recent triumph died down today with the arrival of terribly grisly news. Generaloberst Karl-Adoft Hollidt, leader of the investigation that discovered and crushed the terroristic Waffen-SS cell hiding within the heart of Germany, was found murdered in his home. According to a police report, he was found on his bed, stripped naked, and stabbed numerous times in the torso. Furthermore, it seems that he was castrated (while still alive, according to a coroner) and his genitals were stuffed in his mouth.\n\nThe only possible culprits seem to be another Waffen-SS cell demanding revenge for their destroyed comrades, though they were careful enough to avoid leaving hard evidence. Already, the somber mood within the Wehrmacht's high command is fading, and mourning wails are becoming replaced with calls for retribution."
 reich_chain.46.a: "Mein Gott, how horrible!"

A divided English society will serve as a better grounds for an invasion than a united one.\n\nThe second is to use the swelled-up size of the National Front to begin directly attacking into England's industry, sabotaging its economy and temporarily stunning its industrial capacity in hopes that we can both dampen civilian and military output by the time we launch the invasion.\n\nThe third will be composing the invasion force.

Both men called for aid, with nearly every Wehrmacht and SS squad in the city scrambled to the scene. For six tense hours, the city square was a showdown between two masses of riflemen while the generals hollered obscenities and accusations of treason from behind the firing lines.

Schulz justified his actions by claiming that the Abwehr informed him of a plot against his life by SS agents, although the SS-managed Gestapo has dismissed any evidence of this to be a forgery to justify personal vendettas.\n\nAs a result of this crisis, tensions are running higher than ever.

He placed the speech notes on top of the podium with sweaty hands, surveying the room in apprehension. The speech was short and simple, admittedly a little bland. Bormann smiled to himself bitterly. He had never been able to match the striking visual imagery and acerbic wit of Goebbels' writings. At times like these, he almost missed that lecherous little rat.\n\n"Gentlemen," Bormann announced into the microphone, waiting as a blanket of silence gradually fell upon the crowd. "The Führer!" He turned to his right and saluted. The guests followed suit, rising to their feet and saluting to varying degrees of hastiness. Adolf Hitler shuffled towards the podium and grasped it with two trembling hands.\n\n"Recent events may herald a diplomatic shift for the Reich..." Hitler's voice quickly faded away. Bormann's blood ran cold as Hitler looked up and eyed the hall in confusion. "Where... Where is Ernst? He told me he would be here..." Bormann strode over to the podium and placed an arm behind the Führer's back, gently leading him away. The old man's body was violently quivering.  "I think... I think I was at your wedding!" Hitler exclaimed loudly, his rasping voice reverberating throughout the hall. Confused murmurs erupted throughout the crowd. "Are you still in the SA?"\n\n"Forgive me, gentlemen!" Walther Hewel exclaimed, swiftly taking the podium as Bormann and Misch led Hitler through the exit. "The Führer was accidentally given my speech. Allow me to continue.

Reichsminister Werner Naumann and representatives of the RMVP stood with famous artists and reporters of the state press. Hitler's pompous adjutant Julius Schaub was shooting daggers at Martin Bormann, who was watching the Führer like a hawk. They were all nodding respectfully as Hitler began to discuss the late painter Adolf Wissel, pretending to ignore the two trembling hands thrust awkwardly behind his back. Despite Brandt's severe protestations, Schaub had insisted that Hitler travel to the Führermuseum in Linz to officially open the new art exhibition.\n\n"... including a newly commissioned sculpture of my successor. Now, unfortunately for the young men here today, it is the curse of great artists to die before their time. Adolf Ziegler passed away only a few years ago, and Arno Breker's recent death has wrecked the world of sculpturing immensely." The crowd slowly turned to the left podium where Arno Breker was frozen still, his eyes darting fearfully around the room. Brandt wiped his forehead again with a drenched cloth. "Many of you are too young to remember the days of degenerate art..."\n\nThe Führer trailed off. His whole body suddenly tightened up and he staggered into the right-hand podium. Brandt's blood turned to ice. Hitler's arms violently jerked out and his head snapped forwards, slamming into the marble podium with a sickening crack. A gasp of horror exploded from the audience as the Führer crumpled to the floor, blood pouring from his forehead, arms and legs still writhing. A woman screamed. A man yelled a curse. Rochus Misch was yelling at the crowd to stay back. Bormann rushed forwards and slipped on the blood with a yell, staggering into Schaub. Brandt turned Hitler onto his side and inspected the wound on his forehead. It was just a cut. The doctor shot Schaub a glare as the uproar reached a fevered pitch."

"Let's cut to the chase, Doctor. Will the Führer survive?"\n\n"As long as my medical orders are not interrupted by the likes of Julius Schaub," the Doctor spoke after a brief pause, "we should see a turnaround."\n\n"Schaub is a pompous oaf," Bormann said through gritted teeth. "Ignore him and continue your good work. I will be sending a man to deliver reports to the Führer at three in the afternoon on a daily basis. Goodnight." Bormann placed the phone down and took a deep puff of his cigar. It was the burden of great men to suffer for their people. Whether Hitler lived or died, at least he would be privy to the Berghof's beautiful views. Bormann snapped his fingers at the man sitting opposite him. Gerhard Klopfer lifted his head from the pile of documents and straightened his back. "Listen up, Gerhard. I need you to organise a meeting of the Reichstag in one week's time. I'll be giving reassurances to the Party that the Führer is medically fit, while also emphasising the importance of remaining mentally and politically prepared for his sudden passing. I'll also use the opportunity to denounce the reformist and the militarist scum, and to attack Speer and Göring for not attending such an important gathering."\n\n"They won't be attending?" Klopfer raised an eyebrow.\n\n"Not if they're given the wrong date," Bormann grinned. Göring had always been an easy target, and Speer had nowhere to hide now that the Führer was incapacitated.

He was watching the Führer like a hawk, ready to leap forwards in an instant. Despite his deteriorating condition, Hitler had gently asked Brandt if he could maintain his old ritual of strolling to the teahouse on Mooslahnerkopf Hill. Julius Schaub had soon caught wind of this and, despite Brandt's numerous protestations, forced him to adhere to the Führer's orders. That smug sycophant was striding alongside them, inhaling deeply as he basked in the sunlight. Imagining that idiot tripping over and smashing his face upon a rock gave Brandt some modicum of relief.\n\nHitler suddenly halted in his tracks, panting heavily. Brandt dived forwards just in time to catch the old man by the shoulders as he collapsed backwards like a puppet without strings. His face was pale and covered in sweat, and his breathing was raspier than usual. Brandt gently lowered him to the ground and turned him on his side, tearing off his own jacket to place under the Führer's head in anticipation of a seizure. As he suspected, Hitler's body soon began to jerk uncontrollably.\n\n"Don't just stand there!" Brandt shouted at Schaub, who was staring at the two of them in distress. "Get Kempka! Now!" Schaub nodded and raced back the way they had come. After a few minutes, the seizure stopped. Hitler was breathing raggedly, clutching at the dirt beneath his hands. His eyes were filled with tears.\n\nAt last the car arrived. Erich Kempka leapt out of the driver's seat and thrust open the back door.

Even with the Führer away in Bavaria, Bormann did not think twice about slaving away so late into the night.\n\nIt was early in the morning when Gerhard Klopfer entered the room and gave Bormann the harrowing news. Their contact in the Berghof had been in touch. The Führer had slipped into a coma. Sadness and dread swirled in the pit of Bormann's stomach as he sat silently at his desk, ruminating on the future. His Führer was on the cusp of death, and his enemies were not going to sit idly by once this fact reached them. Though Bormann's support base was strong, Göring's militarists would contest his leadership the moment Hitler died. Perhaps if Bormann informed his loyal allies in the Party and the Wehrmacht of Hitler's condition, they would be prepared for any potential conflict? Perhaps if the Reichstag officially declared him as the Führer, he could maintain a strategic position in Germania in the terrifying event of a civil war? The phone shrill rings snapped Bormann from his thoughts.\n\n"Heil Hitler," came Speer's deep voice. "Herr Bormann, I'm sure you would agree that the Führer's absence from the public sphere has not gone unnoticed. Doctor Karl Brandt has served Hitler faithfully, and the only thing preventing a faster rate of recovery is Julius Schaub's interference. As the designated successor, you should remove him from his post immediately and publicly condemn him."\n\n"You want me to scapegoat Schaub to protect Doctor Brandt?" Bormann scoffed.

Now the dreaded moment to step into the light had come.\n\n"You must not tell anyone!" Bormann suddenly snapped, slapping his palm against the table. "The Berghof staff must be silenced. This information cannot be allowed to spread, under any circumstances. The Reichstag must pronounce me as Führer before Göring or any of the others have a chance to intervene."\n\nThe minutes turned into hours. The hours grew into days. Soon, despite his greatest efforts, the rumors had spread throughout the Reich. The Führer was dead. The Reich was officially leaderless.\n\n"What?!" Bormann roared into his phone, shooting to his feet. "They fucking did what?!" He slammed the phone down with a curse and paced the room, rubbing his temples.

"Your hard work will not go unrewarded; I can assure you. Have a good night!" He placed the phone down and strummed his fingers against the desk. The Führer's absence provided an opportunity for further action. If he hosted a military parade and delivered a grand speech glorifying the Wehrmacht, it would satisfy the likes of Schörner and Remer, while also infuriating Bormann and making him look weak and incompetent. Afterwards, he could propose a meeting in the Reichstag, in which he would paint the Führer's secretary as a closet liberal, no better than Speer and his crypto-Bolshevik agitators. As long as the gap between the conservatives and the militarists was bridged, Göring would face no opposition from the Party.

There was not a sight in the Reich so beautiful, so German. Speer smiled sadly to himself.\n\n"It was wise of you to bring the Führer here," Speer said to the man beside him.

Speer placed a reassuring hand on Brandt's shoulder and stared deeply into his eyes. "You told me earlier that Bormann sends one of his lackeys here at 3pm, every single day, to deliver a report to the Führer. Well, I will send my own man earlier in the day to give you a different report. When Bormann's lackey arrives, I want you to inform him that the Führer is asleep, but you will dutifully pass on the documents when he awakes.

Making Bormann look weak and incompetent was simple; he just needed to ignore any orders directed to him by the Führer's secretary, while strengthening the SS in the process. Göring's faction drew its power from its unity, but a secret brothel recording obtained by the SD would soon change that. The Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Stuckart, one of Göring's closest friends, had been caught on tape explicitly mocking Schörner and Remer, their strongest military allies.\n\nAs for Speer? The SD had also uncovered an illicit affair between one of Speer's reformist technocrats in the Ministry of Economics and a university student with ties to radical liberal movements. Upon the leaking of the scandal, Gestapo agents will waste no time in spreading rumors that this affair is not an isolated incident, and that the relationship between the Party reformists and the liberal students is more than ideological.

The tape soon clicked to an end.\n\nHeydrich took a deep breath and stroked the device, his mind adrift on the violent waves of indecision. The Führer was on the cusp of death, and Speer was doubtless preparing for the inevitable. His clique of degenerates were not the largest threat, of course; Bormann's corruption had brought him much support in the Party, while Göring's pathetic weaknesses were perfect for his militarist puppet masters. The Schutzstaffel had to prepare themselves, both militarily and in mind, for the upcoming war that would tear the Reich asunder and usher in a new age of National Socialism. Even if the Reichstag declared Heydrich to be the Führer, he would never be able to hold on to Germania as a strategic position. Military preparations had to be made without hesitation or delay. He was torn from his thoughts by the ringing of the phone.\n\n"Heil Hitler," came Speer's deep voice. "Reichsführer, I'm sure you would agree that the Führer's absence from the public sphere has not gone unnoticed. Doctor Karl Brandt has served Hitler faithfully, and the only thing preventing a faster rate of recovery is Julius Schaub's interference. As the designated successor, you should remove him from his post immediately and publicly condemn him."\n\n"You wish to scapegoat Schaub instead of Brandt?" Heydrich considered for a moment. "Very well. I'll kick that weasel from the Party for good measure. Tell Bormann and Göring to condemn him too. We must focus the public's attention on Herr Schaub." And away from Hitler, he thought."

###Intro Events###
reich.600.t:0 "The Brown Eminence"
reich.600.desc:0 "If one were to gaze upon the drab visage of this balding little man, it would be hard to view him as anything more than a stuffy bureaucrat, one single cog in the grand mechanism of the state.\n\nSuch a miscalculation could be a potentially fatal mistake. As Chief of the Party Chancellery and Private Secretary of the Führer, Martin Bormann has climbed the greasy rungs of the NSDAP in silent persistence, asking for neither fame nor excess on any step of his rise to authority.\n\nHis friends and foes alike refer to him mockingly as 'the Brown Eminence'. Such a scatological slur means nothing to Bormann, who cares little for humor and less for personal insults directed towards his character. He is not a man of pomp or ceremony, but of duty and dedication to the Reich. Many would claim he is rarely seen stepping out of the Führer's gradually diminishing shadow – except those who whisper of his visits to beautiful young actresses and models throughout the nation.\n\nAs the new decade rolls on, Martin Bormann continues to stalk the shadowy corridors of power in his ill-fitting suit, further enveloping himself in the mechanisms of the Reich's bureaucratic apparatus. The bizarre contradiction of such a despised man holding such enormous influence betrays a mind dedicated solely to the pursuit of power – whatever the cost may be."

reich.601.t:0 "The Gilded Reichsmarschall"
reich.601.desc:0 "If the Führer is the paternalistic ruler of the German Reich, then Hermann Göring is its popular uncle. Beloved by the civilians for his jolly demeanour and the Wehrmacht for promoting their interests throughout the decades, the Reichsmarschall has always desired to maintain the reputation of a diligent military man, loyal to his Reich and his Führer.\n\nTo believe such a thing would be to downplay the man's ambitions. Having held many illustrious posts, from founder and chief of the Gestapo to the Reich Plenipotentiary of the Four-Year Plan, the aristocratic Göring has developed a lust for power and wealth few could rival. Residing in his enormous Carinhall mansion with his vast collections of outfits, jewellery and artwork (plundered from the Reich's conquests), the Reichsmarschall continues to coalesce as much influence around himself as possible. While not as close to Hitler as he once was, he has acquired relevance by becoming the de facto figurehead of the militarist movement.\n\nSome would argue that Göring is little more than a pompous buffoon, allowing himself to be puppeted by radical forces in the hopes of acquiring even more attention and power. Others would find such a suggestion to be foolish, for Göring has long proven himself to be as manipulatively cunning as he is dedicated. His role in the future of Reich politics remains to be seen."

reich.602.t:0 "The Reichsarchitekt"
reich.602.desc:0 "A figure often overlooked in the convoluted politics of the Reich, Albert Speer is nonetheless one of its key players. Architect by profession, and personal friend of Hitler from the beginning of his rise to power, Speer was attracted to the future Führer's persuasive dialectic and his great plans for Germany. The attraction was mutual: as soon as Hitler looked at Speer's work, the young architect found himself launched at the forefront of the party leadership, and tasked with designing dozens of public buildings.\n\nThe war changed everything. Speer was appointed Minister for the Armaments during the most difficult time of the conflict, and it was there that a side of his personality made itself even more evident: opportunism. He took the merit for Germany's production surge, but his main contribution to the war effort had been the invention of what would forever change the Reich: slavery. Hundreds of thousands of inferiors and war prisoners toiled and died in the military-industrial complexes, fuelling the German war machine with their lives.\n\nAfter the war, Speer returned to his passion, and single-handedly designed the culmen of the Reich's grandeur. Germania, the new Caput Mundi, was set to overshadow Rome, Paris and all great cities around the world, but then the economy crashed, taking his dreams with it. In a moment of catharsis, he understood that slavery had been among the main reasons for the collapse, and in the most opportunistic of moves, he started speaking against it, asking for reform: as an unwanted consequence, he soon found himself the focal point of a large reformist movement advocating for change. Swept by currents stronger than him, he decided to follow them, desperately hoping that no one would ever discover his mistakes.\n\nFor good or for ill, Albert Speer has, in his own way, reshaped Germany, forever changing both its architectural fashion and its society. He is, and forever will be, the Reichsarchitekt."

reich.603.t:0 "The Blond Beast"
reich.603.desc:0 "Formerly the Protektor of Bohemia-Moravia, Director of the SD and one of the principal architects of the Endlösung, the very name Reinhard Heydrich is uttered in fear by German citizens and Slavic slaves alike.\n\nA man of infamously intellectual and cultured sensibilities, the Reichsführer of the German SS hides his insatiably animalistic hunger for power behind a cold sheen of quiet reservation. While his meteoric rise in influence and status throughout the 1930s and 1940s surprised nobody, few could have predicted his ascension to the leadership of the Schutzstaffel would come as a result of Heinrich Himmler's failed coup in the 1950s.\n\nDespite its many fractures, the Party is unified behind its hatred of Heydrich and fear of his SS. Many believe it is only Hitler's respect for 'The Man with the Iron Heart' that enables him to maintain such a position of brutal authority, although others would point to a different source. Heinrich Himmler, tyrannical despot of the mysterious Ordenstaat-Burgund, is theorized by many to be the true power behind the throne.\n\nWhile Heydrich and Himmler have their disagreements, both men advocate the return of 'True National Socialism' – by which they mean an end to the corruption of the Party, and the imposition of a totalitarian state dedicated to the values of the SS. The attempts by Hitler's Inner Circle to reduce the influence of the SS has not been entirely unsuccessful, but as long as Reinhard Heydrich remains to be its leader, it will not dissipate so easily."

reich.604.t:0 "The Gang of Four"
reich.604.desc:0 "The Reich is a granitic edifice, firmly under the Führer's control, and utterly dedicated to the glorification of the German people and National Socialism. This is what the propaganda tells, but in truth, large cracks run throughout the entire façade of this seemingly powerful giant. Both inside and outside the administration, weak voices ask for change, for reform, anything -they say - to stave off the inevitable collapse of Germany's crumbling empire. Among this choir of whispers, four manage to stand out, barely audible in the blaring propaganda: they are the Gang of Four.\n\nKurt Georg Kiesinger is a prominent member of the NSDAP, with deep connection to many organs within the Reich. While charismatic and cautious, his reformist views didn't endear him to the conservative leadership. Ludwig Erhard is an extremely respected - outside of Germany, that is - economist, who had already predicted the economic collapse. Of course, in a modern version of Cassandra's tale, no one listened to him until it was too late, and his vehement critics earned him many enemies. Helmut Schmidt is an expert diplomat who joined the NSDAP mainly to cover the fact that he hates national socialism with a vengeance. His ties to the American business would greatly help Germany, if anyone cared to listen to his advice. Henning von Tresckow hails from the ancient Prussian warrior nobility, and is - as expected - a general in the Heer. Disgusted with the state of the Wehrmacht, he wants to reform it along the old Prussian standards, which made him not exactly a friend of the high hierarchies...\n\nEach an expert in his own field, the members of this small group of reformers have put themselves under the wing of Albert Speer to avoid persecution. Even though their relationship with their patron aren't always as idyllic as they would like - mainly because, unlike them, Speer is a convinced nazist - they all depend on each other to protect themselves from the SS, and to plan Germany's future so that it may be better than the present."

reich.606.t:0 "Agent Kleiner Fuchs"
reich.606.desc:0 "Among the many agencies dedicated to rooting out any danger to the Reich's integrity and continued supremacy, none holds so much power as the Abwehr. At the top of such a large and convoluted agency, with tendrils digging deep into all offices and bureaus of the equally large German administration, a single man sits uncontested: his power is enough that he can order death without having to ask for permission, and even the SS must tread carefully within his reach.\n\nReinhard Gehlen, better known as Agent Kleiner Fuchs, is a secretive man, a quality that goes very well with his role. Had it not been so, he would have long since been dead... With cunning and skill, Gehlen rose through the ranks of the Abwehr, making important allies and equally important enemies, but no friends: it's difficult being friends with someone who holds enough evidence against you to send you to the concentration camps for the rest of your life...\n\nAmong the countless agents working under him, one stands out, one he has taken the slightest bit of attachment for. Gerhard Wessel - known in the field as Agent Verfilztes Kätzchen - is a capable officer hailing from the Wehrmacht, and has been Gehlen's protegè for almost a decade, ever since he discovered his ability with analyzing large amounts of complex data, and quickly devising plans and countermeasures: while not the best field agent - something which Gehlen tries every day to change - Wessel possesses both competence and loyalty, a rare combination of qualities these days...\n\nIn a world of shadows, the one who rules over them is in charge, and in the Reich, all shadows, be they large or slim, grey or pitch-black, swear their allegiance to Agent Kleiner Fuchs."

reich.607.desc:0 "The so-called 'Monster in Uniform' of the Wehrmacht, Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner made a name for himself during the Second World War as a talented strategist and brutal commander, leading troops in the invasions of both Poland and the Soviet Union.\n\nDespite this, while glory in this War was heaped upon him by Erwin Rommel, Hans Speidel, and even Hermann Göring himself, the Feldmarschall’s name as it's known today is not looked upon favorably within wider bureaucratic circles. Ever ambitious, Schörner desired nothing less than to be head of the entire Wehrmacht itself! Though a brilliant military man, his skill was not enough; his dreams of promotion were dashed against the rocks of reality by his cataclysmic performance during the West Russian War of the 1950s.\n\nConsidered a failure by many and generally despised by both subordinates and superiors alike, Schörner has nonetheless forged a path as an influential leader in the Reich's Militarist faction, and is considered to be Hermann Göring's number one man. To the likes of Hans Speidel, who he despises, his clique is little more than a psychotic band of sabre-rattlers. To Schörner and his followers, however, they are the saviors of a decaying and dying German; a noble band of warriors demanding greater power for the Wehrmacht and an increased sphere of German influence in Europe and beyond."

A former Hitler Youth leader, the Second World War would see him deployed on nearly every front the Reich fought on. Participating in Poland; France; the Balkans; Remer impressed his superiors during Operation Barbarossa, where he led his own regiment in Ukraine with distinction.\n\nIn the following decade, Remer managed to claw his way to commanding his own corps just in time for the West Russian Revolutionary Front's invasion of RK Moskowein. Again, he led with distinction in the fighting against the Communists. Remer's corps was also instrumental in sabotaging Himmler's coup; he and his men arrested more than their fair share of SS formations when Speidel sent his orders.\n\nRemer has not been sitting idle since then, however. Ferdinand Schörner made his acquaintance with Remer shortly after the market crash of the 50s, and the two aligned thanks to their staunch opposition to any and all military cuts. As of now, Remer acts as Schörner's right hand man for the most militant of the German command staff. Highly intelligent and ambitious, Remer is certainly a man to watch. An opportunist at heart, the role he is yet to play within the Reich is unknown, for better or worse."

reich.72.t:0 "The Adler is Launched!"
reich.72.d:0 "The port city of Wilhelmshaven houses some of the largest - and oldest - shipbuilding facilities in the entire world. Its awe-inspiring drydocks are capable of building nearly anything; everything from corvettes and minesweepers to gigantic battleships have left these docks, even when the idea of a German nation was still a new concept. Karl Dönitz knows the production capabilities of these facilities; as Oberbefehlshaber der Marine, he has seen dozens upon dozens of ships launch over the years, but this is a moment which will go down in history.\n\nToday, the largest and most powerful aircraft carrier of the Kriegsmarine - christened "Adler" by Hitler himself - is finally ready for its maiden voyage, a spectacle that will be broadcasted all over the Reich! This enthusiasm hasn't been felt by the upper echelons of the Kreigsmarine, however. Admiral Dönitz knows what remains unspoken: the Adler is not the latest capital ship, but the last for the foreseeable future, as the Reich can no longer afford to build new ships as per the 1958 budget. Funding had been slashed in nearly all sectors; ship maintenance and payrolls are all that the Kreigsmarine will be bankrolling for now.\n\nThe ceremony was lovely, the Führer himself thanked the admiral profusely for his tireless dedication and work, with vague promises spoken about "more funding for the Kriegsmarine soon", something he has done since 1958. Dönitz cermonally nodded when he needed to and offered thanks when appropriate, as he had done dozens of times before. Ever the model military man, he greeted the rest of the Führer's entourage. He shook hands with Martin Bormann first; an upstanding gentleman, really. Next, Albert Speer; an opportunistic Nazi, no more, no less. If Speer was opportunistic, then Dönitz wondered what Göring would be considered; the man was looking surprisingly spry as well. Last but not least, Reinhart Heydrich's cold, clammy hand. A Blond Butcher, and a bastard to boot.\n\nThe Admiral glanced back over at his Führer, who was blabbering to an aid. He was getting old, and old age was not treating him kindly. God help the Reich once Hitler was…\n\nDönitz pushed the thought out of his head. He was a navy man, first and foremost. Let the politics to those four schemers."

reich.609.desc:0 "The Schutzstaffel are once again stirring up trouble within the Reich. While this isn't exactly uncommon or new, the SS couldn't have chosen a worse time to re-commence their usual antics.\n\nAll across Germany the SS have been putting their noses in where it doesn't belong, causing a great deal of disruption throughout the Reich. Stormtroopers have bullied troops from the regular army out of several armories across Germany, mostly concentrated in the Rhine. Several brawls between them and the Heer have also been reported. The SS are also disrupting flight schedules in order to "screen" pilots and passengers, even from the Luftwaffe! This is a thin veil to harass them, nothing more, and shouldn't be mistaken as anything else.\n\nThey have felt the need to make their presence known to the civilian population as well, carrying out their own investigations of the citizen population. Anything ranging from "forigen spy" to "tax evasion" has been used as an excuse to detain and harass people; they even have the backbone to set up checkpoints with no approval from anyone but themselves, and have been able to freely arrest "suspected Jews and other undesirables," who are more often than not critics of the SS. With these fanatics causing so much chaos, some kind of action must be decided on soon to limit their activities and restore some semblance of sanity."

However, protests have become much more frequent and intense after Hitler announced his successor.\n\nIn major cities all across the Reich, German students have held rallies and marches across university campuses, with some migrating into the streets. Sit-ins have effectively shut down most campuses, and students have taken it upon themselves to block off government and army buildings. Many of the larger gatherings are flat out refusing to disperse, and students at many of the sit-ins refuse to budge. A large crowd of over two hundred people even blocked off an SS barracks! It was a miracle that no one died.\n\nWe need to do something about the student protesters now before the situation spirals out of our hands. One way or another, we need to take action. "

Nearly all sectors of the German economy; agriculture, manufacturing, and even construction are glutted, dominated by slave labor. Uneducated Germans are hard pressed to find jobs, forcing them to survive on state welfare. This has made labor involving higher education super competitive, and even our best and biggest struggle to find jobs!\n\nThe situation only worsens year after year, with no solution in sight. There are simply not enough private sector jobs to go around. The German economy needs a major overhaul, with the first being to address the dismissal state of German employment. While we could certainly just conscript more men to drop unemployment or increase benefits and payouts, it may be prudent to start phasing out slave labor and returning these jobs to the civilian sector, even if it is at the expense of the industrialists.

New movements occasionally pop up every now and then, before quickly dispersing into nothing, quickly being forgotten. The new Aryan-Feminist movement however, has not.\n\nSpearheaded by a large group of female college students, the new group has been organizing marches, rallies, and meetings in a number of major cities. Reactions are mixed; many conservative NSDAP members are disgusted, arguing that women's purity needs to be preserved and that the German woman's purpose is to be a caretaker. Some of the more traditional women wholeheartedly agree, seeing their place in Germany as an essential pillar of the German family. On the flip side, many younger women chaff at the thought of remaining second class citizens in their own country, and demand more freedoms and acceptance from the population at large. Many reformers, and even more than a few (silent) conservatives are in agreement and see the grievances laid out as valid.\n\nWith popular opinion split and marches and rallies becoming more frenzied, the government needs to step in and offer guidance, one way or another.

Slave labor dominates most labor intensive sectors of our economy, and it represents a huge portion of our GDP. The institution is old enough to contain a new generation that only knows the walls and barbed wire of the labor camps. For a while now, the slave population has been slowly but steadily rising, and it is apparent that we now need more living space for the increased number of laborers. The camps are starting to overflow with people, and their living conditions are steadily declining.\n\nAlthough it is inconvenient, something should be done now. Living conditions aren't safe for the slaves, which makes it dangerous for the Germans that guard and employ them. The most simple option available to us is to build new labor camps, but there are also more... creative approaches we can consider."

Their only means of survival have hinged on the state continuing to provide them benefits. While the economy was crashing, many small business owners closed their doors for the last time. Major corporate interests throughout the country silently consolidated their holdings and bought properties, machinery, and expertise for next to nothing. German citizens were replaced with cheaper slave labor, and their jobs simply never returned. A decade later, wages still haven't returned to their pre-crash levels, even with ten years of inflation for the few that still work.\n\nThe German people yearn for some kind of action; we can not be content to sit and watch our citizens suffer.

The group is one of the few public organizations that weathered the economic crash last decade with a semblance of grace. They have always had funding, if not from the state than from fundraising they do themselves. This has allowed them to continue to operate, and has also given them some autonomy from the government.\n\nThe Hitlerjugend has naturally evolved; it is not the same youth group of the 1940s. After a decade of (relative) peace throughout Germany, the program began to de-militarized. They are now more akin to the American or British scouts than the group of old, though they still honor their material traditions.\n\nWe have on our desks a couple of proposals to mold the Hitlerjugend into something more of our liking. Every year, high standing party officials review the scout's training regimates. If we so chose, we can lean on these members to influence the structure, and therefore future of the Hitlerjugend."

After the Second World War, plans were put into motion to see the expansion of the Autobahn to all corners of German dominated Europe, from Moscowien to the Gibraltar dam, and everything in between. Ambitious expansions were planned for the booming and growing cities of the Reich, and were proceeding smoothly.\n\nThe great economic crash of the 50's put a quick stop to everything. Funding was massively cut, making the planned expansions simply impossible. The highway has begun to decay from chronic lack of maintenance.\n\nA stack of proposals have been sent over to our desks.

We proved the world our strength by accomplishing what many considered impossible; we retained tight control over our conquests, then expanded our empire even more by occupying the entire middle section of the dark continent! Since then, we've spent the better part of two decades crushing army after army of partisans, as well as a Russian invasion.\n\nThe economic collapse of the 50s made the burden of maintaining the Heer’s budget a titanic struggle. Although many begged for funds to be funneled elsewhere, Hitler stood by the Wehrmacht and would not hear of it. Therefore, for the last two decades, Germany has somehow miraculously maintained its military budget, for better or worse without another major economic crisis.\n\nMilitarists in both the Wehrmacht and administration continue to lobby to maintain current spending to this day. On the other side of the isle, a coalition of reformers, civilian interests, industrialists, and even limited numbers of conservatives from the NSDAP beg us to cut the Wehrmact’s budget for much needed allocation of funds elsewhere. Being in a position of power ourselves combined with Hitler's ailing health allows us to now make a change in policy, if we so choose."

A casual observer may mistake active duty warships in dock as a mothballed fleet! It is only under Admiral Dönitz's personal care that the U-boat fleet is even somewhat combat ready.\n\nThere are no disagreements throughout the administration; the surface fleet is severely lacking. Our analysts estimate that even the Italian surface fleet is stronger than ours! Them! A disgrace! To get the navy up to a standard befitting our status as a superpower would require nothing short of a total restructuring of our navy, complete with new ships, technology, and tactics. At this time, there is no feasible way we can achieve this. However, there are some temporary remedies available to us.\n\nBy cutting some of the Admiral's salaries and reducing waste, room in the naval budget for substantial improvements is possible. Be it weapon system overhauls, repairs, new electronics, or even just a new coat of paint, we have an opportunity to finally shape up the Kriegsmarine."

Our loyal troops oversaw the creation of the greatest empire the world has yet seen; it was therefore only fitting to reward them accordingly. Many veterans were given lands to settle, positions of power and influence, prestige and more than their share of wealth. This was easy enough to handle following the days of our great victory.\n\nThis has set a precedent of entitlement. Yet another generation of soldiers are retiring, and there isn't near the amount of wealth to go around; there simply hasn't been any new conquests. Still, they expect, and even DEMAND the same compensation the heroes of the last war were gifted, even the men who haven't seen a lick of battle! The most vocal of the new veterans are the last of our men to see real war; the veterans of the West Russian Conflict. There is no doubt that they suffered greatly to hold back the tide of red rats that threatened Moscowien, and therefore only ask for their fair share.\n\nIt is time we handled retirement benefits once and for all, so we can finally end the debate of what the veterans are due."

Stuckart of course did not take it sitting down and leapt up in indignation to begin what would be a shouting match between him and the ardent Schörnerite.\n\nGöring excused himself from the meal to no one's notice. It would have been a waste to sign away his great popularity with the likes of Schörner and his band of merry mad men. No, destiny awaited.

To celebrate this historic moment, I wish to extend a cordial invitation to a dinner at Carinhall. I have been told that you are a man of expensive taste and on that front I believe that Carinhall is second to none. I have also heard that you are a man of many ideas and reforms, one who wishes to bring the Reich to new heights. Although my past exploits were of the military kind, one thing I have learned in my time as a politician is this: one can never have too many men to keep the peace when less imaginative minds wish to keep things "the way they were". For such fiends, I can only recommend the bayonet. I understand that your Gang of Four would be your main advisors, but perhaps there is room for one more. My popular support and military prowess would no doubt shore up further support for your cause, and there is no other government that I would rather serve under than yours.\n\nSincerely,"

reich.702.d:0 "Albert Speer thought it amusing how informal and relaxed the letter was after reading and re-reading it. The letter barely seemed the type of correspondence that could have had far-reaching consequences on the Reich Speer was to inherit and manage going forwards. For a moment, it was tempting: Göring was a media darling and also someone who would no doubt move a lot of fence-sitters towards his side, but everything else about him would be more trouble than he was worth. Primarily, his very nature would create an imbalance in the already fragile Gang of Four. His old sabre-rattling reputation would put him at odds with Schmidt, and his terrible economic ideas would no doubt butt heads with Erhardt. Göring too was a man who enjoyed the spotlight and would probably try to steal it from old 'Silver Tongue' Kiesigner and, well, Tresckow...\n\n"Herr Speer, Tresckow is waiting in the lobby to see you."\n\nSpeak of the devil. "Oh, send him in, please. Thank you." Speer had made up his mind by now: Tresckow would be the one to handle this. Göring and Tresckow were never amicable in the first place. Perhaps Schörner would enjoy knowing about this also. Of course, the details could all be handled in due time. When Tresckow opened the door, he was surprised that Speer had been standing up and waiting for him - seeming more animated than his usual self. For once perhaps, they may yet agree upon something."

As such, I would like to cordially invite you to Carinhall for dinner. I believe we have much to discuss with regards to the future of the Reich. With your firm commitment to National Socialist principles and my popular support, truly no enemy - internal or external - could hope to stand a chance against our great Reich.

After folding the letter along its creases, he slid the sheet of paper back into the envelope. Bormann, with envelope in hand, slowly walked towards the burning fireplace crackling on the far side of the room.\n\nAs the shadows of his fingers flickered in front of the fireplace, it had given him an idea. Göring wanted to get away from his puppeteers. The fool that he was, Bormann was going to bet that those shadow masters would no doubt wish to see this little letter he had. He turned back towards his desk and sat down once more, letter in hand. Picking up the phone, Bormann said to his secretary: "Could you put Feldmarschall Schörner on the line?"\n\n"Of course.

reich.705.d:0 "Göring strolled out of his office with a sigh. His gambit had failed. He was wedded to the militarists for now. The letter to the successor was leaked and Schörner came calling about his "betrayal". Göring had lied to him: the conservatives had sent the letter without his knowledge and set up the meeting. By a stroke of luck, Schörner believed him - but Göring knew that Naumann wouldn't. It wasn't as if he didn't try, explaining to the Reichsminister how the militarists had done that on his behalf. After all they'd been through, Göring had thought there would have been some quotable last words on either side - but Naumann didn't even manage to finish his sentence before hanging up on Göring in exasperation and disbelief. In one phone call, his conservative support had died.\n\nAs he strolled through Carinhall's art section, one painting caught his eye. It was one of Napoleon; he was sinking into his chair, defeated. There was no commanding gaze, no passionate look, it was a blank stare towards nothingness. Initially, it was there as a matter of pride: nowadays, who, after all, was the Master of Europe? The Führer's was not French, let alone one called "Napoleon". However, now Göring looked at the painting with a new sense of empathy. If Schörner and his War Plans were successful, then he would no doubt go down in history as one greater than Napoleon ...but Göring knew deep down he was no Napoleon. Even with the greatness of the Reich, the later War Plans would be near impossible to achieve. On that day, when his armies falter and his people groan, he wondered if someone would ever make a painting of him."

gcwcapture.1.t:0 "Fall of Leipzig"
gcwcapture.1.desc:0 "Leipzig has fallen!\n\nThe birthplace of Johann Bach has been the center of heavy fighting in recent days. Martin Bormann's forces have been driven out of the culturally rich city, but at a hefty price. Germans from both sides lay strewn throughout what remains of the city. Though damaged, many of Leipzig's culturally significant buildings still stand, although heavy artillery bombardment has devastated the industrial parks, and many civilians wander the streets, digging through the rubble for lost loved ones. In the center of the city, over three hundred men have created a formidable holdout in the Monument to the Battle of Nations, though surrounded and low on supplies, it is expected they will surrender soon. \n\nBormann has suffered a great defeat today. It remains to be seen if his loyalists will be able recapture this strategically important city, or if it will remain occupied indefinitely."

gcwcapture.2.desc:0 "Nuremberg, once the beating heart of our party and the origin of some of the greatest political marches on Earth has fallen today.\n\nThe wide streets, once loud and crowded with NSDAP supporters lay barren, their only witnesses to our past glories being the corpses lining the streets. Bormann loyalists were spread throughout the city. Combined with a hostile civilian population, the aggressors had no choice but to sweep the city house by house, apartment by apartment, block by block. The city was, for all intents and purposes, a giant fortress.\n\nHeavy urban fighting has taken its toll on both sides, along with the civilian population. Thousands are dead, and the city has been gutted. The loss of this stronghold is a disaster to Bormann and his men; if the frontlines can't soon be stabilized, much of southern Germany will lay wide open to attack. Much of Southern Germany may soon suffer the same fate of Nurenberg if the defenders fail to rally."

gcwcapture.3.desc:0 "Bormann's citadel on the Rhine, Stuttgart, has been over-run. The fighting that has lasted these last few days has finally come to an end, and a dreary silence has fallen over the once prosperous city.\n\nMany civilians tried to hole up in their homes or flee as German fought German across vast automotive complexes and corporate skyscrapers. Some early reports estimate that over 60% of the city has been destroyed, and the little housing that remains have quickly become quarters for the newly arrived conquerors.\n\nAs most of the civilian population that remains scrounges for the few resources that lay unclaimed, only one question remains unanswered; will Bormann return?"

Bormann's loyalists fought in every street. Civilians were press ganged into labor brigades, homes transformed into makeshift bunkers, and streets blocked off with an assortment of ruble, ruined vehicles, and whatever else could be tossed into the streets. Massive bombardments softened the city before the main attack commenced, and combined with an equally determined infantry assault, the defenders were forced to withdraw from the city.\n\nBorman's position is precarious; with enemies deep into Southern Germany, many speculate that his faction is close to collapse. Whether he and his loyalists can rally and recover or not remains to be seen. "

The city, barely standing after the first fight has been thoroughly racked by heavy ordnance and leveled. Many of the old opera theatres and old music studios were filled to the brim with hostiles; there was no saving those buildings.\n\nThe people of Leipzig are suffering greatly; much of the city's infrastructure has been totally destroyed, but Bormann's troops have been doing what they can to assuage the suffering of their newly liberated brethren. News of what the men found at the Monument to the Battle of Nations has spread far and wide; those three-hundred who bravely died are being hailed as heroes and martyrs by their comrades; their charred remains finally being put to rest.\n\nThe fighting has exhausted both attackers and defenders. It is to be seen if Bormann will be able to keep up his momentum and push deeper into Germany proper, or if this is the extent of his resurgence. In any case, Martin Bormann is by no means out of this war just yet."

Bormann's troops, to the fanfare of his people, have returned.\n\nDirty, ragged Swastikas are hung from the ruins as the army marches through the streets. Bloodied citizens cheer as the impromptu triumph makes its way through the ruins like the early days of the Reich. Gunshots ring out as a nearby group of men are led to a standing wall and forced to kneel, their betrayal paid back with a single bullet to the head. Rabid civilians meanwhile hunt down whatever stragglers they can. Usually, the ex-occupiers are simply beaten to death, but more than a few corpses hang from street lights and buildings, the sign Verräter usually nailed or hung to the body.\n\nRecapturing Nuremberg has given the NSDAP loyalists a much needed moral boost. They have regained the momentum for the time being, but it is to be seen if Bormann and his men will be able to keep it."

gcwcapture.7.desc:0 "It is Stuttgart's turn yet again to feel the fires of war, for Martin Bormann's battered army has returned with a vengeance.\n\nThe city is once again secure, but at a great cost. While military losses are unknown, the civilian population and infrastructure has been decimated. The great automatic plants of the city, Porsche, Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen, Bosch and a few others have been completely reduced to rubble. No one will be making any breakthroughs here in electronics, and it seems that not many guns will be coming out of the city in the near future. Still, the city is strategically important, and Bormann once again controls this important junction. No one quite knows where he'll strike next, but with Stuttgart in his hands, that list is long indeed."

Most counted Bormann as good as dead, with the other factions infiltrating so deep into his main area of operations. However, at least temporarily, his forces have recaptured the vital city of Munich after heavy fighting.\n\nThe city itself now resembles most of the other urban battlegrounds throughout Germany; ruined, lacking running water, low on foodstuffs, and now of negligible industrial importance. Some of Bormann's core lands still lay under occupation as well, but it appears that he has stabilized the frontlines, as well as making limited advances in other areas of Southern Germany. It remains to be seen if Bormann's momentum will continue unabated, or if this was just the spasms of a dying warlord."

The building to building fighting has torn apart the old medieval center of the city. After Speer's loyalists turned the section into a virtual fortress, those on the offensive lost their patience and decided to level most of the culturally rich old quarter.\n\nLingering gunshots ring out as Speer's supporters are hunted down to the man. Goethe University, once the largest school in the city is now little more than a grave for those who made their last stand there, the only occupants being the corpses of the defenders lying next to a bloodstained, ruined wall. And everyone is asking themselves the same question; will Speer recover, or is he finished?"

A deathly silence has fallen over the city while civilians pick over the bones of their prior lives, looking for scraps and loved ones.\n\nOnce again, Speer's men fought with valor and courage, but once again they were thrown back and routed from the battlefield in the face of overwhelming firepower. Hanover's now ruined industry and strategic location was vital to Speer's war effort; without this important strategic center, Speer's position in the northwest is precarious indeed. Rumors fly around that Speer and his loyalists are on the backfoot, and that another major defeat like this could very well knock him out of the war."

gcwcapture.11.desc:0 "The capital of the proclaimed "Reformers of Germany" has fallen today, but that hasn't stopped the killings for the now trapped soldiers who are hiding throughout the city.\n\nThe battle was cataclysmic. Steadfast and zealous students clashed with an equally determined enemy. The bombardment of the entire city did little to dampen the spirits of the defenders; Speer loyalists of all ages took up defences in the rubble and patiently awaited the inevitabile assault on the city itself.\n\nThe fight more resembled a death struggle reminiscent to the great battles of the East than a simple clash of a split country as waves of young men attempted to storm important locations; many of them mowed down in the streets. Back and forth battles raged for important buildings that still overlooked tactically vital areas of the now ruined city. Strongpoints too stubborn to fall were repeatedly hit with ballistic and ground-based missiles by the attackers. Supported by tanks and APCs, one by one the city blocks began to fall. Cars loaded with bombs and artillery shells were the response, and more than a few of the surprised attackers met a grisly fate as these makeshift bombs started to hit convoys, troops formations, armor and strong points. Refusing to surrender after the fall of the city, Speer's forces abandoned their military wear and blended into what remains of the civilian population, which is currently being brutalized as the conquerors exact revenge and try to root out the remains of the reformers.\n\nWhile this bloodbath raged on, Albert Speer and his most important advisors quietly left the city, their current location unknown. As observers watch these events unfold, one recurring question keeps being asked; is this the fate that awaits the rest of Germany?"

The defenders, facing a determined foe from both without and within, decided to coordinate a fighting withdrawal. Losses were heavy for both sides, and more than a few civilians were shot, confused for combatants. As Speer's men finally pushed the last of the enemies out of the city, more than a few grizzly scenes greeted the now not so enthusiastic men. Blending in with the civilian population, while very effective, extolled a heavy price from the people. Hundreds of innocent Germans line the streets, blood still oozing from their heads or dripping from the walls they were lined up against. Perhaps the worst sight is at the Goethe University. In the middle of the campus, over a thousand college aged men and women lay in a series of ditches they dug themselves, if the abandoned shovels strewn around is anything to go by. The vast majority of them remain unburied, and the stench is unbearable as grieving locals sort through the dead.\n\nThe city is firmly in Speer's hands now, but the cost was great. It remains to be seen if Speer and his reformers are willing to continue to pay such a blood price for victory."

Trucks full of fighting men meanwhile sweep the city for any "unwelcome traitors." Most of those captured are shot on the spot, the rest taken by vehicle to somewhere outside the city. Meanwhile, a wave of civilians have come forwards to point out collaborators, fellow citizens who sold themselves to the enemies for trivial amounts of food, water, and medicine. Many of the accused have been taken from the city and have not been heard of again, their status unknown, but their families fear the worst.\n\nAs Speer's men celebrate this major victory, the generals and officers make plans to take the fight to the enemy's strongholds. Whether or not Speer actually has the strength to carry out his ambitious plans remains to be seen. Rumors of mass shooting outside the city remain unconfirmed, the many gunshots attributed to "target practice.""

Saying the fighting was underhanded would be a vast understatement; Speer's militia used the mostly intact sewers to move around while pickup trucks with heavy machine guns bolted down in the beds sped through the streets. Speer's staff claim that their enemies resorted to using poison gas underground, and resorted to mining many of the streets to attempt to halt their enemy's relentless advance. Using the night as cover, one final mass assault decided the fate of the city; the occupiers were forced to withdraw after being simply overwhelmed by the ferciosity and numbers of the reformers offensive.\n\nThe city is battered; most of its industry is in ruins, the infrastructure is barely functional, and the civilian population is in dire need of relief. Still, the capital and home of the reform movement is one again in Speer's hands. The victory has given the battered reformers some much needed hope."

The canal lays mostly unused; only the husks of ships line the embankments now, with the occasional pontoon bridge dotting the landscape. The fighting in the city itself was brief but fierce. Perhaps as many as three thousand civilians tried to escape the warzone by boat, but the harbor had been mined, most of the shipping was sunk as a result, along with their human cargo. Göring's men meanwhile laced most of the major parts of Kiel with explosives, and used the resulting destruction and chaos to withdraw from the city, at the expense of the civilians.\n\nGöring has been driven out of the strategically important city, and the rest of Jutland lays open, but the human cost has once again been great."

The citizens of Rostock watched with dread as the fighting krept closer and closer to the city. Hopeful citizens rejoiced when the enemy advance stopped just short of the city. The celebrations were cut short as a shocking artillery and aerial bombardment rocked the entirety of the city.\n\nIt is suspected that the would be conquerors were simply tired of the protracted resistance, and that such a brazen show of strength would break the city's spirit. The bombardment had the opposite intended effect.The civilians, who had up to this point been indifferent supporters of Göring, rose up in anger and defense of their homes.\n\nSaying the line between civilian and soldier was blurred is a vast understatement. After sustaining heavy small-arms fire from plain clothed civilians all across the ruins, many people wearing plain clothes were simply shot on sight in the streets, with few expectations. In response, the fighting took to the underground. The city's vast drainage and sewer systems were extensively used by Göring and his newfound allies to great effect. So great, in fact, that the underground systems were "allegedly" gassed more than once, and combat engineers were deployed to collapse the tunnels, increasing the damage to the already destroyed city. Rostock University, one of the oldest centers of higher education in the world and headquarters of the defenders was hit multiple times by ballistic missiles, completely leveling it. It wasn't until after the fighting concluded that the attackers learned that it was actually being used as a hospital and refuge for suffering citizens; not a single soldier was killed in the strikes, and there are well over a thousand dead buried in the rubble.\n\nGöring's men, bloodied and battered, have retreated from the broken bones of the city, covered by his airforce. For the time being, it looks like Göring is being put on the defensive in North Germany."

The fighting has reached new lows; men have resorted to clubs and torches in this fighting as supplies become more and more spent while the killings continue unabated.\n\nThe defenders were well prepared; civilians and slave laborers were directed to dig and construct an impressive ring of forts around and throughout the city. Strong points were meticulously chosen throughout the city, and many first generation settlers volunteered to take up arms against the approaching enemy army, refusing to see their homes fall without a fight.\n\nBoth sides got their fight. The attacker's dreams of a quick victory was dashed as they ran head first into the outer fortresses. Even after sustained heavy artillery fire, missile strikes, armored assaults, and then massed infantry attacks were only some of the fortresses compromised. Trying to assault the city with nearly half of the outer fortresses still operational proved to be disastrous and a constant thorn in the side as the defenders stubbornly fought on inside the city itself. A daring assault by professional army soldiers finally split the defenders in half, ending organized resistance in Posen.\n\nAlthough the city is still a warzone, enough control has been established for the attackers to claim victory. A couple forts still stand defiant, lobbing heavy ordnance at whoever comes a little too close to their perimeters, but Göring's remnants, for all intents and purposes, are trapped and irreverent."

It was no elite Heer sniper, or even a veteran of the Great War. It was a boy, no older than fifteen, wearing a Hitlerjugend uniform.\n\nHeavy fighting started up after the attackers finally entered the city. Artilitary crews drank heavily as they launched their ordnance. Most of the snipers had turned out to be boy scouts ranging in age from as old as seventeen to eleven, and every call for sniper suppression was more often than not a death sentence handed out to German children. It would later be discovered that the local youth leaders were mostly hardcore supporters of Göring who had called upon their members to "fight for the true Fuhrür of Germany" and "save our homes from rapists and looters." Currently, the new owners of Kattowitz are too busy keeping their heads down and methodically combing the ruins for snipers to do much of either.

Motorized infantry arrived on the battlefield, and the occupiers resigned to fight in the now encircled city.\n\nThe tables turned as Göring's men stepped foot into the ruins. The strongpoints that they once held were now used against them as they tried to push into the city's center. Armored vehicles were basically moving targets with no room to maneuver while ruins laced with explosives went off as the attackers took cover in them.

The people who "volunteered" were strapped with bombs before mingling in with other civilians fleeing SS brutality, starvation, and massacres. As they were pushed deeper into the city, the SS began to use literal human shields; hundreds of men, women, and children were forced to march towards the enemy lines as SS troops followed close behind with panzers and armored APCs. Only a tragic few caught between the crossfire survived.

As more of Strasburg fell, entire blocks would burst into flames, having been wired to explode. Suicidal SS attacks would almost always hit formations hit by these massive explosions. In either an act of mercy, or afraid that straggling citizens may interfere with their plans, most of the city's population was allowed to leave before the fighting. Leniency on the attacker's behalf may have backfired, as SS soldiers managed to infiltrate with the refugees, and now attack their enemy's backlines. Worse yet, it looks as if Heydrich has managed to escape along with most of his general staff.

The SS got a little taste of their own medicine; as they advanced,  entire streets would burst with fire. The whole city was rigged (again) with bombs. The SS troops stopped their reckless advance, and cautiously and patiently combed through the city, slowly cutting their way through the rings of defensives. There was no quarter given to either side, and little attention was given to the poor souls who were once again caught in the crossfire.\n\nHeydrich's men did eventually come out on top.

 reich.555.d:0 "With the Reich tumbling headlong into chaos, the silence from Crimea has grown increasingly deafening. The home of Germany's Black Sea fleet and with enough naval infrastructure to construct a small steel island, the bustling port has seen a huge amount of attention, with rumors of daily arrivals of 'gifts' flooding the Governors stately home on Greuthungistraße. However, despite the constant flow of gifts into Theoderichshafen, barely any information has come back out. That is until early this morning as a frenzy of communiques filled the airways. \n\nFamous naval hero Karl Dönitz took to the radio around 7am to denounce the 'turncoats who, in Germany's darkest hour, dare to strip her of the liberties she has enjoyed since her birth' - no doubt a reference to Hans Speidel disregard for the sanctity of the Reichstag. As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany: the conservatives of Martin Bormann.\n\nNo doubt as surprised at this victory as their rivals are crestfallen, several key Bormanite commanders have publicly accepted Dönitz' support, claiming that only a war hero as true and pure as Karl Dönitz could have seen through the thick smoke of our 'degenerate propaganda' and into the incontrovertible will of Adolf Hitler. This is a devastating blow to our cause - defections in the navy had already begun, and, most worryingly there are fears that the undecided naval commanders we've spent the last few weeks wooing may now rally to Dönitz's, and by extension Bormann's, banner."

Admirals from across the Reich, from every conceivable fleet and theatre, have apparently sent communiques to Theoderichshafen commending Dönitz's actions. His denunciations have evidently hit a chord with much of the German navy, particularly those who had been feeling uneasy about publicly choosing a side in the civil war, offering an apparently 'neutral' face-saving alternative. A fanciful story has even begun to circulate about four sailors from Wilhelmshaven who jumped overboard and swam over a mile to land when the captain announced his support for Albert Speer instead of Dönitz. \n\nWith ships from across the Reich rallying to Dönitz's banner, and therefore, to Bormann's, prospects are looking increasingly dim for the other contenders. Luckily for us, a number of admirals have publicly rebuffed Dönitz's overtures, openly mocking the hypocrisy of executing a coup against the Crimean governor in order to protest a markedly similar event in Germania."

What was unexpected, however, was the discovery of the body of Reinhard Heydrich in his office.\n\nKilled from a single shot to the forehead as he sat behind the desk, the state of the office suggests that Heydrich was in the process of packing up to leave when he was killed, and reportedly other evidence further implies that he did not expect his sudden demise.

Surely, they could see eye-to-eye on this issue, and realize the need for cooperation with former enemies against a new fiend.\n\nSuddenly, the door swung open, shocking the architect as it slammed against the finely sculpted wooden wall. "CHEATERS! CHEATERS, CHEATERS!" Hitler screamed in his nightgown, his eyes bloodshot and his face red with anger. "My player is the scorn of Germany!!!"\n\nSpeer stood silent, unable to respond. The elderly Führer continued his triade. "Years and years of playing Hearts of Iron, just to learn how to use the state transfer tool! I never used a single console command, yet I conquered Europe all by myself! Shame on all of you!"\n\n"Adolf, please calm down! It's me, Albert!" Hitler stopped ranting at the ceiling and turned to face his old friend.\n\n"Schinsser..." He closed his eyes and his expression turned into one of defeat. "Please, just... Restart the game. Fairly, this time."\n\nSpeer shook his head, hiding his confusion. "Ja, of course." He proceeded to run downstairs, to restart the heating system. Hopefully, his lapse was just from the cold."

 reich.1000.desc:0 "The dinner party was elegant as always. Well dressed men and a few women talked and strolled through the gardens and terrace of the American embassy. Martin Bormann followed their paths absent-mindedly as he watched from a window higher up in one of the many conference rooms.\n\n\"It is very simple Herr Botschafter, Speer doesn't have the support necessary. His few supporters may be loud, but they are few and fickle to boot. It would only be a matter of time until they turned against you as well if given the chance.\"\n\nHe turned his gaze away from the window again to face Walter C. Dowling. His attempts to sway the American ambassador had been frustrating so far to say the least. Bormann had tried everything in his political and diplomatic toolbox; from reason, to charm, to veiled threats and even various historical and scientific anecdotes. All to convince this man that he was the better choice for the Americans to befriend than that spineless Speer. It hadn't worked.\n\n"That's all very well and good Mr. Bormann, but as of right now the government of the United States sees no reason to comment on the internal affairs of a sovereign country such as yours."\n\nTwo hours later, annoyed, exhausted and barely containing his anger Bormann would leave. It was pointless - the Americans wouldn't support him."

It wasn't supposed to be like this. All those years of work building his web of influence and support. The Reichskommissariats should have been his staunchest allies, and indeed some of them were - but they all had their own problems.\n\n"So that leaves us with Halder, Best, the Africans and Serbia."\n\n"No Sir, Serbia and the England garrison are necessary to keep the areas under our control, they can't spare any troops. And with respect Herr Bormann, the African RK's would take weeks to send over significant amounts of troops and material. That is if rogue elements in the Kriegsmarine don't intercept them."\n\nHis aide looked almost as tired as he felt.\n\n"So the Danish garrison then? Well, it's better than nothing I suppose."\n\nBormann left the room to make a call to Best.\n\n"When I am done with the traitors at home, I swear I will make sure the Reich is never disunited again." he muttered to himself.\n\n"

Partially out of ideological fanaticism, but there were enough that just were looking for the one with the best pay or the ability to guarantee their future. Bormann had worked overtime, secured funds through his contacts, siphoned off a few secret deposits, even diverted party funds. But he had done it, obtaining enough bribe material that even some of the more steadfast Waffen-Soldiers might reconsider.\n\nAll that was left was to set up the meeting with some intermediaries and Bormann would find himself with some new allies.\n\nThe door to his office flew open. \"Herr Bormann?\" Bormann slowly turned to face his aide who had just rushed into the room.\n\n\"I am busy, can't it wait? Also did you forget what knocking is?\"\n\n\"Sir, I am sorry but, it's about the Führer... he passed away.\"\n\nBormann stared and didn't say anything. His plan undone in a moments notice.

When the police entered the building, they found the former German leader dead, murdered with an icepick in his study.\n\nThe news is a shock, not only having brought great sadness to the liberals of the world who had rallied around the reformist, but also greatly harming the credibility of the United States.

reich_shared.23.desc:0 "With the end of the Bürgerkrieg, volunteers from all sides return to their homes after risking their lives in the defence of their ideals. Some, however, will be remembered more than others.\n\nToday, the entire Wehrmacht honors the final retirement of Erwin Rommel, the "Desert Fox" who led the Italo-German invasion of British Africa. The old general, who had been living as a civilian for almost a decade, had rejoined the army in the civil war, bringing with him his legendary ability with Panzer tactics: while no longer a tank commander due to his old age, his keen insight in armor warfare, combined with the legendary reputation that followed him ever since the days of the Afrika-Korps, inspired many to fight well beyond their own capabilities.\n\nNow, however, the tired Fox has announced his second - and final - retirement from the Wehrmacht, citing his failing health and the sadness from fighting fellow Germans as the main reasons. While some would have wanted to keep him to help rebuild the armed forces, no one dared suggest it, so respected he was. After a final parade where he saluted the crowd atop an old Panther tank, he was escorted to his home covered in even more medals than he already has, to enjoy his final years."

I know the ten of you are busy men, so thank you for dropping your prior commitments for this important meeting."\n\nIn front of you are packets of what is expected of us in the next two or so hours. Take five minutes and review it." The various junior staff officers, some of the brightest in the Heer, looked at the contents of the slim flies in front of them in surprised silence. Discipline won the day however, the only reactions being occasional looks of surprise.\n\n"It's an honor sir," one of the junior officers finally spoke out. Another chimed in. "What do you require of us?"\n\nFor five hours, the eleven men walked around a physical map of the British isles. Known radar stations, missile silos, naval ports, locations of shipyards and civilian ports, anti air weapon systems, and more. Anything that could in any way affect military preparations was mapped, tagged, logged, or noted. Potential beaches for landings were all marked, and potential areas where landing forces could get bogged down were duly mapped. The results were mixed.\n\n"There's potential." was the word of the day. "But so much could go wrong," was often the reply. "Should we rely on the Luftwaffe again?" Followed by "They'd expect that, what about the navy?" to only be countered by "We still need to invade the damn island."  Finally, after hours hunched over the map, the senior officer finally straightened his back.\n\n"You are all correct." The noisy room fell silent. "Like in the Second Weltkrieg, all of our branches will need to work together to ensure success. Neither the Luftwaffe, the Kriegsmarine, or the Heer will be enough to crack the island. As we've seen," the man pointed at the map. "The island looks more like a fortress than it did two decades ago. Modern radar. Missile silos for ground, air, and sea targets. Small numbers of jet planes, portable surface to air missiles, and more. We will need to give the operation our all. Every plane, ship, and man will be needed to minimize losses. Control of BOTH air and sea is essential." "But sir. Their missile systems will cause great damage no matter how we approach the island. How do we handle that?" an officer asked. The older man smirked slightly."

"Come here." The officer wordlessly followed the mechanic out of his office to a nearby metal catwalk. Below them was a hanger choked full of mothballed jet planes of all sizes and varrients being outfitted, maintained, and repaired. "Take a good look, kid." The officer, twenty-five, looked over the older man. Though he was technically in an administrative position, his air force uniform was stained; he had been working himself it seemed. "I don't mean to be sharp, and I shouldn't shoot the messenger, but take a look. You guys are simply asking too much!"\n\n"I know, sir. It is a lot. But apparently the order comes straight from the Fuhrer's office himself. They want every plane with a jet in the air, within reason. End quote." The older man groaned softly. "We just got done fixing the last gen interceptors and fighters on the base. We haven't even touched the Hortens, let alone the Junkers. And do you know how many parts the bombers need? Christ. And they want Arando ARs too? That first gen crap?" The younger officer shuffled around. "Uh, yeah. And the JU 390s. Maybe the old helicopters too." Another sigh. "You know they don't make the parts anymore, and we're out of spares for the old stuff. We're gonna have to start cannibalizing parts from other plans to continue." The younger man nodded. "Lucky for you, our boss isn't an idiot, he understands." The younger man handed the older officer a file with a memo that was two sentences. "Huh." the mechanic said. "At least someone gets it."

The radar station right outside of the city is totally shot. Officers say it was hit by thunder, only way to explain the damage really. Guess we should make sure those lighting rods get replaced cause shit, that was an expensive mistake. Most of the radio towers got knocked down. At least one of them was taken down by some god damn vandals. Big kids with nothing better to do. The operators caught them and they ran away. All pretty big and strong, probably the god damn rugby team. Fucking kids. Got some people missing. My chief has actually been gone since last night when he got a call outside of town during the storm. Got some guys searching the roads now, but can't even find his car. But, rumor has it he had a missus, if you know what I mean..." The firechief coughed and gave the lieutenant a dirty look. "Uh, anyway..."\n\nWhat else. Eh, nothing crazy after a storm like that. Some damage to trains, lotta trees blown down on power lines, hell, probably the most I've seen yet! And I've been on the force for...\n\n"What if it's not all storm damage?" The firechief cut in.

"But they didn't... it was from the..." the officer stopped mid sentence. Holy shit, you... you don't think someone is trying to cripple us, right? The firechief looked around, then outside the window, before shutting it. "My guys were the first men on the scene at that radar station outside. It wasn't hit by no lighting. The powerlines? The trees that fell on them? Half of them have cuts. And have you ever heard of a radio mast fucking falling over? I've been chief for twenty years, that shits never happened. Last night, three toppled over. Three! And we know at least one was... what did you say, vandalized?" The police man nodded slowly. "Horse shit. Those weren't just kids I bet. And I bet if we go and look, they'll all have damage from where some assholes cut through the braces, or smashed, or however the hell they did it." "Uh, they had these like makeshift bomb things.

"Who has the naval infrastructure damage report?" The man on the left motioned. "Great. Give me that first."\n\n"Yes sir." The officer thumbed through his folder. "Lets see. The worst damage is our oil storage tanks at the harbors were damaged. The valves were tampered with and forced open before being broke. The harbors are a goddamn mess right now. Some asshole then broke into one of the port cranes and dropped a storage container right on top of one of the storage tanks before trashing all the electronics in it. Operator we interviewed admitted he always left the key in the crane." Herbert sighed. The man paused before continuing. "Other than that, not much else happened. Two guards were found dead by the oil tanks, found them only a couple hours ago  because they were dropped at the base of the damaged oil tanks, so cleanup didn't see the bodies 'til they plugged the damn things. That's about from me, sir."\n\n"Christ," Herbert muttered. "And you?" He pointed to the man on the right. "Well, they found that police chief's body two nights ago. Guy from Sussex? Gunshot to the head. Car ditched at the edge of the woods out there. Power lines in many rural regions are still down. Definitely sabotage, someone is cutting trees and dropping them on the lines. Most of our radar installations in the south of the country have taken some kind of damage. Most of them are up and operating though. Seems increasing security after that storm last week saved us a helluva lot of grief." He paused, then continued. "That's about the extent of it. I also inquired to see if I could answer your question. If anyone has captured any of the culprits, no one is saying a damn word, it's all hushed. Nothing in the papers still other than an occasional article referencing freak accidents. Not sure how the government is gonna supress what happened at the ports though.

The miles of bunkers, pillboxes and constantine wire that crawl along the islands coast can be attributed to the military decision-making back in Washington, as can its artificial harbors that were made deep enough for the vast hulls of the United States Navy to harbor into. The Airforce, never to be outdone by the other branches, put a titanic amount of effort into clearing and building the vast concrete hangers that dot the island's many airfields which allow the fearsome B-52 to take off within a moment's notice, representing SAC's nuclear first strike capabilities.\n\nWith all decisions routed through the Pentagon, it was no wonder that the small fishing issue was ignored for so long by military analysts as it just wasn't seen as a priority. British fishing trawlers had been clawing ever closer to the coveted fisheries in Icelandic waters, butting heads with the Icelandic fishing industry and causing quite a stir in the minority civilian population on the island.\n\nThe Pentagon has finally agreed to expand the Exclusive Economic Zone of Iceland, to better enforce her waters.

As is tradition, the Heer and Kriegsmarine alike is pushing for our destroyers to clear our waters of these interlopers, by whatever force necessary.
