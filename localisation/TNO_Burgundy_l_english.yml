 egy.15.t:0 "King Farouk of Egypt Dead!"
 egy.15.desc:0 "Farouk I of Egypt has been reported dead by joint statements from Cairo and Rome. Notorious for his extremely lavish lifestyle, in recent years he had gone on tours, trips and benders of increasing cost and intensity. Almost bringing Egypt to bankruptcy through his partying alone, he has now died the way he lived: gouging himself on all kinds of luxuries.\n\nAt one particularly large event, complete with royal delegates, government officials, lavish food, an expensive band, and a ludicrously large number of designer drugs, Farouk appears to have finally indulged too far. During dinner, his weak heart appears to have given out and was pronounced dead where he sat, with a chicken leg in his hand.\n\nIt is doubtless Egypt will now face troubled times with the death of their King, but some certainly also praise the loss of a man who made them foot the bill time and time again. Others suspect that perhaps he was poisoned by would be usurpers, but currently the primary belief is that he simply ate too much."

Now with full knowledge as to what happens if we let such terrors stew about, we must ensure we deal with these abominations before they cause any more potential destruction against the Ordensstaat.

These units were populated by the few within the degenerate nations able to demonstrate capabilities and ideological soundness worthy of the title of "Aryan". For a time we had hoped that these collaborating legions would be able to fulfill some of the lower needs of the Ordensstaat -- disciplining workers, maintaining order in the conquered territories, and suppressing partisans -- to leave the real work to our pure-blooded German shock troops. \n\nAlas, for it seems that we have gotten all the use we can out of these units. Reports from the SD indicate that our allies are infested with plots of betrayal and sabotage, and may soon rebel all together. The time has come to liquidate these fools, degenerates who never should have been raised as high as true Aryans.\n\nHowever, we must move carefully. We dare not attack the collaborators all at once, to do so might cause a full-scale civil war. The first step is to lay the groundwork for further action by weakening the logistic supply-chains and readiness of our foes by covert action. Soon this obstacle will be dealt with, and the long march of the Aryan towards triumph can continue. "

In order to have a chance to catch our so called "allies" in wrongdoing and sabotage their ability to resist, we must meticulously and efficiently infiltrate our foes using SD agents honed by years of external-operations in the globalplans pursuant to the vision of our glorious Riechsfurher-SS.\n\nFor the moment however, the priority is stealth. We will invite the leaders of SS-Charlemagne to wine and dine with us, the leaders of SS-Langemark to share their finest pies and pastries, and the SS-Walloon to tour their gorgeous meadows and streams. All the while gathering info and evidence about their degenerate treachery.  Then, when the moment comes, our strike will be swift, powerful, and decisive."

Although we have already devoted a great portion of our resources and ability towards these endeavors, we have not yet even begun to plumb the depths of our allies' cowardice and betrayal. \n\nSo however high the cost grows, we will make sure that our agents have whatever they need in order to discover the evidence we need to finish off our foes. Although a few might wine that the cost is too high, and these resources might be better spent furthering the economic strength of the Ordensstaat, or on the completion of the Globalplans, we know that our best chance is to defeat the legions in a single decisive blow, so that they pose no threat to the sustainability of the National Socialist Burgundian system, and its manifestation in our long term goals."

Since its creation, the sole and ultimate purpose of the Burgundian Way has been The Plan, our moment, our perfection, our final solace.\n\nBut it seems that the Aryan Race must be tested once more before it becomes immortal. While the completion of the Reichsfurher-SS's greatest project is of course our most crucial objective, it is equaled by the necessity of destroying the sneaking filthy disgusting degenerate "collaborators" who have for so longed poisoned the sanctity of the Ordensstaat as the only true manifestation of the Aryan.

Little did the collaborators know that for once the degenerate outsiders were right. Their existence IS a contradiction -- a deviation from the true path of the Burgundian Way. And at last, a contradiction that has been removed from the annals of the Aryan.\n\nAs expected, the Walloonians were caught unawares by our attack. Deceived by our covert distraction-operations, and unable to compete with the fury and firepower of the SS in open battle, they put up little resistance to their former brothers. What weapons they possessed have been captured, their headquarters have been occupied, and their leadership has either surrendered or died fighting.\n\nAt long last, the Ordensstaat will no longer have to suffer these pathetic idiots -- more interested in their puny "nationalism" and small luxuries than in the completion of our true purpose. And indeed, our victory has made our path towards this purpose more certain than ever -- without such small distractions, the completion of the Plan lies within our grasp, we need only reach out and grasp it."

The fools will conveniently destroy each other so that in the end we will have only scraps of resistance to deal with -- a good training exercise for our pure blooded troops. After years of exhausting "tolerance" of non-Aryan soldiers, our patience will at last be rewarded with the final purification of the Ordensstaat, and the defeat of all remaining internal resistance.\n\nWe have come so far.

Up until the final moments, the collaborator legions will be wining and dining our commanders, their lay-members playing dice with their German "comrades", and their inner leadership being set false reports of our upcoming offensive against "resistance elements'', unsuspecting that it is they that will soon be eliminated. \n\nThe dream of a pure Aryan state, free of degeneracy and delusions has almost reached its final form.

Surely there are few species of man more immersed in degeneracy and cowardice than the French. And yet for a long time, the Charlemagnians were loyal allies. Against the Bolshevik menace, they stood by our side. During the first righteous attempt of the Reichsfurher-SS to save his homeland, they were among the most effective and hard-fighting of the putschists. Even up until the moment of their defeat, the French legions thought of themselves as brothers to the Aryan soldiers, and perhaps even their equal. \n\nAlas, the degenerate bloodlines of the SS-Charlemagne doomed their loyalty and fighting capabilities from the start. Ever since we expanded the Ordensstaat to include the North-west territories of the former French State, our "allies" from the region have done nothing but whine about our "unjust" treatment of their race and homeland. As such, it was a sad necessity that they be eliminated.\n\nWhen the time came, the soldiers of the lion put up little resistance. Their claims of equality to the Aryan proved hollow as their soldiers ran in terror, and their bases quickly fell beneath the black helicopters of the Ordensstaat.\n\nNow we shall harvest the crop we have sown. The equipment and personnel formerly possessed by the SS-Charlemagne and considered still usable will be retooled for own use against our global enemies, while those unworthy will be sent to the foundries and camps respectively. \n\nWith our last internal enemies all but defeated, we can now turn to our true purpose -- the final defeat of the opponents of the Aryan worldwide. "

 BRG_strangle_their_last_hope_desc:0 "At long last, the final vestige of resistance to the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund has been destroyed. The most recent resistance organization to be caught by our men is the last of its kind in operation, and with their defeat, the unruly natives of the Ordensstaat's countryside are now defenseless against our ambitions upon them. The beautiful musical score written by the Reichsführer-SS can finally be played by the Schutzstaffel orchestra without fear of discordance. Let all the world hear the sweet sound of Aryan supremacy, reaching unto the skies, and await their rightful fates."

 BRG_a_thousand_years_secured_desc:0 "Incongruous cries from the crowd are not the only thing that can spoil an orchestral performance. Each musician must also play his part to the point of excellence. Any pauses in timing, or sour notes—any disloyalty from rebellious Legions—would also ruin the score. The Ordensstaat has suffered through no shortage of such malfeasance, but those days are finally at an end. With the loyalty of the SS secured, and the resistance to its domain extinguished, the reign of the Reichsführer-SS can safely last unto eternity. May a thousand years of harmony ring out."

BRG_DeGrelle_Evidence_4:0 "이상한 행동"
BRG_DeGrelle_Evidence_5:0 "의심스러운 티켓"

BRG_DeGrelle_Evidence_Desc_1:0 "Although Degrelle has his his secret wells, his papers titled Opération Garde du Corps, or Operation Bodyguard, have still made their way into our hands. Unfortunately, the true purpose of his plans can't be understood due to a heavy amount of paranoid censoring obscuring the most useful information, but what is clear is that Degrelle is on the move and is making plans to control his Legion from a place of hiding."
BRG_DeGrelle_Evidence_Desc_2:0 "An old bunker located in Belgium from the Second Weltkrieg, it has become a hive of new activity for the Walloon Legion lately. Reports and travel records show Degrelle has begun turning this bunker into a secondary HQ, away from our prying eyes and hidden under a mountain of faked paperwork. We have three options for finding out its purpose:\n\n- Smuggling out any operation papers or records we might be able to acsess.\n\n- Planting an informant who could report on the activity at the site.\n\n- Prepare a quiet raid to ensure all the information ends up in our hands, no matter the trouble it might stir."
BRG_DeGrelle_Evidence_Desc_3:0 "A small cottage located in the Ardennes, it had been Degrelle's residance for 6 years but now appears to have been deserted by its owner. A skeleton crew of Walloonian guards ensure the spectre of it being lived in, but Degrelle himself hasn't been sighted in it or even the region for months. There are three options to investigate this abnormality:\n\n- Raid the house and disarm the few guards in a quiet attack in order to recover any clues that exist in the residence.\n\n- Focus our efforts on watching Walloon's military HQ located inside the complex complete with bugging to see if anything can be gleaned there.\n\n- Demolish the house after the aformentioned raid to completely uproot any hidden clues to Degrelle's trechery."
BRG_DeGrelle_Evidence_Desc_4:0 "Recently, there have been rumors and whispers of Degrelle acting strangely, always seemingly missing or occupied with some other buisness. Recently obtained meeting minute reports seem to suggest nothing is actually being done in the Legion as Degrelle and his commanders dissapear mid session, never to rejoin. We have three options to look into this development:\n\n- Check his medical records to see if some sort of mental defficiency has caused this recent change.\n\n- Plant a tracking device on his personal car which will allow us to track his movements when he deserts Legion buisness.\n\n- Break into his office and check his personal files to find out what exactly he has been spending all his time on."
BRG_DeGrelle_Evidence_Desc_5:0 "It appears that Degrelle is on the move, at least within the country. Obtained travel records show him spending an inane amount of Walloonian resources on train rides from Ost-Paris to Walloon. The purpose behind these trips are unclear, but finding his destination and the reasoning behind the travel could go a long way to clearing his obstructions. We currently have three options available to that end:\n\n- Watch the trainyards and the surrounding areas to create a visual of Degrelle's movements.\n\n- Track his Location through both agents and digital devices, which does increase the risk of being caught but would be more accurate.\n\n- Interrogate the conductors for the various trains to see if they know anything about what has been going on."

##### Evidence Descs

BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_1:0 "가장 최근의 보고서에서 비축량, 특히 산업용 장비의 비축량이 줄었다는 사실이 밝혀졌습니다. 경각심을 가질 필요는 없지만, 우리는 이러한 절도 사건의 배후에 누가 있었는지를 조사하기 시작해야 합니다. 선택할 수 있는 방법은 세 가지가 있습니다:\n\n- 누가 저질렀는지 알기 위해 노동자 숙소를 쓸어버리기\n\n- 공급망에서 누락된 제품이 있는지 살펴보기\n\n- 공장 역에 숨겨져 있는 것이 있는지 살펴보기\n"
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_2:0 "It seems as if our supply bandits have been using commandeered material trucks to mask their operation, simply portraying themselves as people taking supplies to the dump and then stealing them for their own designs. Our options to put down these criminals are as follow:\n\n- Interrogate the driver of one of the stolen trucks, attempting to get names and information out of him.\n\n- Tracking the various trucks in an effort to learn where they are going.\n\n- Looking into the travel and cargo manifests to glean what they are up to.\n\n"
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_3:0 "Inspecting the nearby factory complexes have yielded in an interesting discovery: some of the workers have been collecting waste materials from an unpstream manufacturing plant. While normally this would be no cause for alarm, this spesific plant dealt with weapons manufacturing and as such its waste has unually high concentrations of gunpowder and sulfur. That, along side the recent theft of extra pipes from our stockpiles, could hint at a much more violent situation. In order to head off this destructive plot, we have three options at our disposal:\n\n- Watch over the garbagemen that clean up those materials and see if they are involved.\n\n- Look into the disposal system and where the materials are supposed to go, and if they even ended up there.\n\n- Test the waste sludge to try and determine exactly what the workers wanted with it.\n"
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_4:0 "It appears as if the conspiracy is much larger then we thought. The funneled supplies from our camps has been discovered in a decommisioned warhouse a half hour drive away from the main industrial center. The purpose or function of the warehouse is unknown, but it is clear some sort of manufacturing base has been set up inside to utilize the stolen materials. The current operaters of the facility are also a mystery, but our cameras have spotted a Poppy flower mark on some of the shipping leaving the building. To get to the bottom of this, we have three options:\n\n- Install secret cameras outside the facility to see if we can capture any enlightening activity.\n\n- Track the logistics of their operation to find our where it's all going.\n\n- Sift through their disposal system in order to find out what they are making and why."
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_5:0 "Tracking the cargo coming out of the Warehouse has led to an interesting discovery: all of it is being delivered to a hidden safehouse located in the slums of Hafenstadt, marked only with a small poppy deceration on the door. Intellegence reports that were taken from Germany during our seperation show the building used to be a Resistance safehouse for downed pilots under the "Shelburne Line", and it appears as if this new group has co-opted and expanded it. While the discovery of this safehouse confirms resistances is not as dead as we thought, it also presents a unique opportunity to finally crack their defenses and end it once and for all. To achieve that goal, we have three options:\n\n- Stake out the building and the surrounding block to find any suspicious activity.\n\n- Track the residents of the apartment complex the safehouse is in to see if anyone could be brought in for "questioning"\n\n- Raid the building and secure it for ourselves to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible."
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_6:0 "The raid of the supposed "safehouse" was quick and easy, resulting in minimal causalties for our men, but what the house reveals dwarfs any deaths. Located underneath a rug that was upturned in the fighting is a trap door that opens a tunnel leading directly to a sewer line, carved into the building itself. We do not know what lies down there and many of our men are reluctant to venture into the dark, but this could finally be the key that cracks this case open. We have three options at our disposal:\n\n- Searrching the catacombs in order to find out how the Reistance has survived under our noses.\n\n- Set a trap and wait for them to come back up to see if we can capture any of their operatives.\n\n- Search the sewers to find if their operation has been extended under the city."
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_7:0 "Deep within the catacombs after hours of expoloring, our agents have found a bombshell. Located within a hidden alcove not marked on any maps lay the headquarters of our hidden Resistance, apparently named Red Poppy. Inside was a printing press, weapon chaches made of pipe bombs and crudely constructured guns, as well as something incredibly interesting: a board filled with information on the Rodomo camp and ways to attack it.\n\nThe group is obviously planning something big, but the only lead we have right now to explaining what that plan might be is a coded message taped up in the center, written in a code never before seen by our department and signed with a mysterious "H". To get to the bottom of this bombshell, we have three options:\n\n- Try and decode the message with brute force methods in order to find out what is going on.\n\n- Find out where the message came from or was sent to see if we can locate the leader of the opperation.\n\n- Look into the "H" that wrote it."
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_8:0 "In our search of the sewers, we found some distrubing files floating in the water. They appear to be targeted propaganda from a group called Red Poppy calling in French on the workers of Rodomo and the camps to rise up in rebellion when the time comes to restore their homeland and future. This would explain the recent spate of accidents and low morale in the camps, but also proposes a new quesion. What more does Red Poppy have up their sleeves, and how far along are they?"
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_9:0 "It looks like this charade can finally come to an end. After painstakingly researching both this group, the code used, and every other piece of evidence gathered before, we have deduced that Henri Grouès is the leader of Red Poppy. A former priest who led Jews out of our grap during the original occupation, he has recently resurrected the long-dead Resistance with the purpose of galvanazing the workers of Rodomo to rebel. Obviously, he must die for his transgressions, but it must be soon, lest his fiery words set the entire Ordensstaat alight."

### Evidence Descs


BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_1:0 "The Charlemagne Legion, led by Christian de la Mazière has long been our potentially most dangerous foe. Dedicated entirely to creating a new ultranationalistic French culture, they obeyed our orders when the only controlled a patch of their homeland, but with the recent acquisition of half of France, Mazière has stopped listening. He and his followers have begun slowly and subtley slipping into defiance, and it must come to an end. To begin our investigation into the disloyal Legion, we have three avenues:\n\n- Look into the rumors that swirl around Mazière's drug use and undevotion to Burgundian ideals.\n\n- Observe the newly conquered territories where Mazière and his men have assumed more and more control.\n\n- Investigate the reports of near nightly disturbances in Charlemagne's new headquarters of Piktenstadt."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_2:0 "It seems like this rumor is in fact true. Digging into Mazière's personal life has revealed a disturbing secret: both he and his Legion have gotten addicted to the large stores of meth left over as stimulant from the Second Weltkrieg. Medical and suspect reports seem to indicate that Mazière lost control of his personal struggle long ago and now commands the legion with a loose fist, but most of them are too high to notice. Obviously such degeneracy should be impossible, especially considering the stores from the 1940s should have run out long ago. To continue to dig into this and find out where they are getting their fix, we have three options:\n\n- Stake out the streets around Charlemagne's headquarters in order to identify the key players.\n\n- Anaylze the crystals ourselves to find out where the drugs are from.\n\n- Bribe the dealers with "immunity" to get them to tell us who is buying and why."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_3:0 "After anaylzing the meth crystals used by Charlemagne, our labs have found some interesting information. They drugs are incredibly rough and diluted, made with improper chemsitry and chemicals that has killed their potency and made them more dangerous then enjoyable. The conclusion from the lab is that Charlemagne is making its own meth in a lab tucked away in their territoy, explaining how they're able to extend their stockpiles. However, we must still find and locate proof of their betrayal of their supposed "ideals", and have three options:\n\n- Map out their distribution networks to track the flow of drugs.\n\n- Dig into the paperwork used to fund and supply this operation.\n\n- Search for and find this lab complex that has existed under our noses."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_4:0 "Bribing the dealers and integrating ourselves into the drug distrubtion network that keeps Charlemagne awake has yielded some interesting results. The enlisted men and officers of Charlemagne seem to use the vast majority of their time throwing wild parties filled with drugs, alcohol, and other forbidden substances instead of performing their actual duties. It would make wonderful blackmail to tie Mazière to our hip once more, but in order to do that we must have conclusive proof. To obtain that, we have three options:\n\n- Install secret cameras in their clubhouses to try and catch somethingthing on video.\n\n- Begin a deep cover operation with one of our operatives and have him infiltrate the sites in order to get proof.\n\n- Tap the phone lines to see if any information is exchanged there."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_5:0 "After much digging, we have finally found the Holy Grail: Signed orders from Mazière himself authorizing the construction of both a drug production facility and recipets for the money used on his parties. They were hidden well, behind many false starts and cold trails, but we now have them in our hand to use at our pleasure."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_6:0 "In the dead of night, a strike team went into the slums of Turon and was able to wrest control of the production labortary away from Charlemagne after finding its location from a few persuaded officers. Tearing it apart, it not only confirmed our earlier suspicions of homecooked meth, but also yielded something distrubing: apparently Charlemagne has been creating their own arsenal as well, having a process for everything from making gunpowder to the guns themselves. This distrubing element of the discovery should be acted upon soon, before the trechery becomes too much to bear."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_7:0 "It appears as if our phone line taps have picked up something interesting. Mazière and his ilk are apparently not satisfied with parties, but have set up a prostitution ring to cater to his officers and Frenchmen he consider's "worthy". Seemingly not notcing how this clashes with the founding ideals of the Ordensstaat, he set up the ring a long time ago and has been using its funds to finance his various extravaganzas."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_8:0 "\nOn our recent fine-toothed examination on the integration of the new territories, we found exactly what we expected. Lackluster efforts made to foster a true Burgundian culture and the ideals of National Socalism, lazy policing practices, and a horrible mismanaged funding situation. While that would be enough to court martial everyone put in charge of this operation, it isn't the most disturbing find. That would have to be that it appears as if Charlemagne has actually actively hindered any progress being made, which must be investigated immediatly. We have three options to do just that:\n\n- Spy on the Culture Officers assigned to this area.\n\n- Comb over the budget to find where the money has gone.\n\n- Check on the Germanification programs that were supposed to be implemented and learn why they never were."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_9:0 "\nThe re-education system for our new territories was supposed to be a model for our glorious future, but instead under Charlemagne's watch has become one of bloat and innefeciency. Administrators regulary complain of supply shortages for German books and language materials, children not even showing up, and worse. They pin the cause of this problem to the complete lack of funding to complete any of their instructions, but what exactly it has been used for is an unanswered question. This problem must be looked into if we are to get to the bottom of this mystery, and to do that we have three options available:\n\n- Investigate the school systems themselves to root out the cause of this problem.\n\n- Review the supply inventory to try and determine where the missing materials have gone.\n\n- Trace the cash flow into the program to find where it has all gone."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_10:0 "\nIt appears as if the closer look made into the cultural Germanification progress has only confirmed our latest suspicions. They were mostly faked, relying on numbers that seemed to come from thing air and using statistics that were physically possible. Not only that, but it also appears that none of the materials bookmarked for the operation were even used or still remain in inventory, a very suspicious development. To further our investigation into these unusal actions, we have three options:\n\n- Look into the French Language Subsugation program to find out why it hasn't been progressed.\n\n- Interrogate the officers in charge of these "reports".\n\n- Check over the teaching curriculum to find out why it has been changed from our orders."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_11:0 "After digging into the missing supplies, the reason behind their dissapearence has been revealed to be even more bizzare then the inital quesiton. Our officers caught some unmarked guards, but obviously of French nature, in a warehouse burning German books made especially for the re-unification effort to power some sort of contraption. After interrogation, it became apparent that this was something that had been going on for a while, all under the watch and uncaring attitude of the commanding officers. Considering the implication this had on the program as a whole, it would behoove us to continue this lead, and there are three possible avenues:\n\n- Question the teachers who were supposed to recieve these supplies and ask them wether they knew anything about what was going on.\n\n- Investigate their power needs and why they would need to burn books for it.\n\n- Uncovering their motive, even figuring out if powering something was just a ruse, could do great things for our investigation."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_12:0 "It seems as if the reason behind the school system's failures has been discovered: a complete and total lack of teachers, who have seemingly dissapeared without a trace. Looking into the reports, it has become clear there is a pattern at work, with many of them simply just not showing up one day after the occupation, taking their books and knowledge, and in some cases, even their students. While the purpose behind this isn't yet clear, the fact that so many highly praised and payed teachers simply went under the radar is an incredibly dangerous thing for our programs and must be investigated. We have three options at our disposal:\n\n- Search the dorms near the schools and interrogate anyone who is left to find wehre they've gone.\n\n- Look further into the paperwork to see if there are any more patterns to discern.\n\n- Comb over the schools themselves to locate any clues at what they could be doing or where they are."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_13:0 "The final piece of the puzzle has been laid down, and it is quiet possibly more shocking then what could have been imagined. In our search for the missing teachers, students, and even materials, our agents stumbled upon hidden, funded, French language schools located around both the new territories and even Burgundy itself. Ostensibly set up by Charlemagne as a desperate ploy to keep their revered French culture alive, students were being taught curriculum glorifying the past French empires with spesific anti-Germanic material thrown in as well. They seemed to have no shortage of materials, including the unconfiscated and missing French books, that would explain the anemic funding elsewhere. If nothing else, this proves Charlemagne must be dealt with as soon as possible. before the Hydra becomes too large to control."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_15:0 "In our search for the truth, we seemingly have stumbled upond a great discovery: French languange and history books, which were supposdly confiscated on direct orders by Charlemagne, were in fact not, and they have been missing from the stockpile for months. The dissapearence of thousands of books teaching and praising the culture of degeneracy would normally not be such a huge deal, but they could potentinally lead to an entire generation turning their backs on our system if we do not act quickly. We have three options available:\n\nLook into the manufactures of the books to find out what was in them and how they could hurt us.\n\n- Examine the authors of the books to see if they have a role in this situation.\n\n- Begin investigating where the books dissapeared to and why."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_16:0 "Looking into the reports of nightly disturbances in Piktenstadt have revealed an interesting phenomenon. It appears if as the entire upper officer corps of the Charlemagned legion meets up in various buildings around the headquarters every weekend. The exact purpose of this gatherin us unknown, but the large amount of limousines, guard trucks, and people has attracted our eyes to the scene, and it appears as if it is worth looking in to. We have three options at our disposal:\n\n- Sweep the surrounding area around their headquarters to see if we can find any leftovers or clues of and for their engagements.\n\n- Survey the transportation patterns of the officers to see if they are meeting up anywhere else.\n\n- Question the locals who have been making these reports and see if they know anything."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_17:0 "After anaylzing the piece of art, we have come to the conclusion that it is in fact Napoleon Crossing the Alps. It was initally unknown how such a high quality picture could have been put on the ticket, so an inquiry into where the painting was located was made. After checking on the stock of paintings confiscated during the initial invasion of France for being deemed too nationalistic, we have realized it has been missing for months. However, it was never requested for removal or destruction, seemingly instead having dissapeared without a trace. No one knows the current whereabout of the piece, but if it appeared on this art, it must be somewhere within Burgundy. To further this investigaton, we have three options:\n\n- Check on the storage site to see if any evidence still lies there.\n\n- Review the transportation records of the facility to pinpoint down who was there at the time of dissapearence, and even, who took it.\n\n- Look into the rest of the collection to find if anything else has been stolen or used."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_18:0 "Our initial sweep of the area led us into the sewers, trashcans, and apartments of Piktenstadt, but they also gave us some trash from the gatherings that became our treature. Located in a bin outside one of the meeting houses was what appears to be a ticket to some sort of attraction. It bears both the mark of Charlemagne, is written in coded French, and has a large painting as its centerpiece. None of our officers can cipher what it means or what it is used for, but we have three options to try and answer those questions:\n\n- Attempt to crack the code of the writing to try and find out what its purpose is.\n\n- Find where it was made and see if that yields any clues.\n\n- Look into the piece of art to see if that has any signifigance."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_19:0 "The attempt at finding out where the tickets came from has succeeded with flying colors. Our agents raided the suspected warehouse yesterday to find a mobile but crude printing press hard at work, making another batch of similar tickets. No one was caught during the raid, denying us any human resources to question, but the entire workshop, including past prints, materials, etc, are all there. Still unknown however, are the purpose of this operation, which must be found out if we are to get to the bottom of this. We have three options avalible:\n\n- Using the old prints, check the history of what this facility has made to see if that unveils any clues.\n\n- Examine the equipment used to construct the press.\n\n- Look into the supply chain to find out how the press got the needed materials to run."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_20:0 "It apperas as if we finally have found the breakthrough we desired. Our agents have recovered an invitation to something called simply "This Weeks Gala", adorned with French art and bearing the crest of Charlemagne. It gives instructions on how to enter, what should be worn (tuxedos and masks), what should be brought, but not what to expect, and as such, this represents a dangerous but lucrative opportunity to finall crack the case wide open. We could:\n\n- Plant loyal moles inside the building when the Gala is to take place, trying to see if thye can get any information.\n\n- Install survielence equipment before the gathering to see if they pick up anything.\n\n- Send in our agents themselves using the invitation to gain acsess to the event."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_21:0 "After looking into the transportation records of the stolen artwork, we have made an amazing discovery: Charlemagne has been using our own trucks to convoy out pieces of art from the descrution pile to their own safehouses located in the new territories. Based on the effort needed to conceal such an operation, we must assume it is both a regular opperation and one that everyone knows about, meaning that it must have been approved by the officers themselves. To look further into this new development, we have three options:\n\n- Investigate the commanders in charge of the stolen APCs to see what they know and what they will reveal.\n\n- Track the movements of the convoys to discerne any patterns or to see where they will go next.\n\n- Take the vehicles in for "repairs" in order to take them apart and see if any hidden evidence lies within them."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_22:0 "The final piece of the puzzle fell into place last night, as the secret of the disturbances was finally revealed. We now have confirmation that Mazière himself has been setting up a weekly high society gala for Charlemagne officials devoted to examining and glorifying French culture. They meet at difference storehouses to avoid suspicion but have nationalistic paintings, specially prepared delicacies usually banned in other parts of Germany, and even history lessons carted in to cater to the officer corps and their friends. Mazière himself often attends the events with an escort and seems to be the worst defender when it comes to sticking to a Burgundian diet, often gorging himself on wine and cheese, but that pales in comparison to the deprevaty of the Gala as a whole. They will not escape this unpunished."

#### Descriptions

BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_1:0 "Although the outward signs of trechery from the days of Degrelle have once again faded below the surface, the Walloon Legion, now led by the incompetent Jean-François Thiriart, still represents a challenge to us. While Thiriart swears his and his countrymen's loyalty to our cause, we know that there is little love between the Aryan and the Walloonian cultures, something that has manifested itself as simple ambilvence in the Legion. They care not for our attempts to create a true Burgundian society, but seem instead content to waste away the days doing nothing but dreaming of their own independent state. And such thoughts, if allowed to run rampant, could be very dangerous. We already know deep resentment and anger towards us Germans runs widely through their organization, no matter how much Thiriart might ignore it, as evidenced during the hunt for Degrelle, and it is unknown what else they might be planning in the shadows. The only clear thing is something is afoot. To further look into this suspicion, we have three options:\n\n- Look into the well documented morale problem among their average soldiers, which has led to some distrubing behavior like desertment and apathy for our cause.\n\n- Review their command structure and try to glean some information from the officers in charge.\n\n- Review the Legion's finances to see if that yeilds any clues."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_2:0 "Trying to penetrate Walloon's officer corps has revealed something interesting: it appears as if Walloon's high command acts near independently of Thiriart and the men assigned to him. Orders are followed on paper, but in reality, the true nerve center of Walloon is a centralized, insulated command post far off in the Ardennes, away from the influence of Thiriart and ourselves. This not only confirms Thiriart's incompetence but also gives us an opportunity to dig deeper into what Walloon might be up to. To do so, we have three options:\n\n- Send a detachment to confiscate their files and see if anything noteworthy comes to light.\n\n- Search the dumpsters and waste disposal plants around the site to see if they have been disposing of any sensitive material.\n\n- Bug their communications array and listen in to see if anything catches our ears."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_3:0 "When the files first crossed the desks of our forensic experts, they were intially discarded as clever fakes. But as more corroborating evidence was uncovered in the trove of documents taken from Walloon's secret headquarters, we have come to the grim conclusion that Léon Degrelle is alive. The entire bunker scene that our men found is now known to have been just that: an elebatorly set up deception that has allowed Degrelle to operate under the radar and without suspicion. We do not know where he is, what he has done since then, or if he even has any remaining connections to the Legion, but it is certain that this development is nothing but bad."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_4:0 "While many were unsure that digging through a trash heap would give us anything usable, they have been proven wrong with the discovery of Rexist propaganda in the headquarters waste bins. These pamphlets expousing the beliefs of the former Rexist Party, led by Degrelle before the war, seem to have been both newly printed and directed at the foot soldiers of the Walloon Legion as a way to combat our influence. Interestingly, it appears as if there is a printer's symbol in the shape of a crown stamped on the back of each sheet, which might allow us to track down whoever has been creating them. To further this line of evidence, we have three options:\n\n- Anaylze the messages of the pamphelt in order to understand what we are fighting against.\n\n- Find the manufactur of the pamphlet by tracking down the orgin of the printer's symbol.\n\n- Look into who has been distributing the pamplets to the Walloonian troops, and how."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_5:0 "It appears as if listening in on Walloon's plans will be harder then anticipated. While attempting to place a bug on their local radio tower, we discovered that they are using radio scramblers and other counter-intelligence measures to safeguard their transmissions. The scramblers seem to only be activated when they are not using they are transmitting messages from outside their headquarters local systems, adding another piece to the puzzle. Obviously, this is something only done when there is something to hide, meaning that breaking through their cover could yeild some grounbreaking evidence. To further this operation, we have three options:\n\n- Interrogate the radio operators at Walloon's headquarters to find out what they know about the system.\n\n- Track the source of the interference and find where the scramblers are being kept.\n\n- Decrypt the intercepted but scrambled messages to see if anything can be gleaned from them."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_6:0 "Looking further into Walloon's off-the-record operations has yeilded the location of an old safehouse, apparently one that was abandoned until Thiriart's takeover necessitated a place to hide the true work of the Legion. Located only a short while away from the secret headquarters, the safehouse is continuously guarded by Walloon's shock troops and other security measures, implying that it holds something valuable. We have three options at our disposal to attempt to find out what that valuable something is:\n\n- Raid the safehouse with our guards in an attempt to stop them from destroying any valuable evidence inside.\n\n- Stake out the safehouse to track the coming and going of the various officers.\n\n- Infiltrate the safehouse with our deep cover operators in order to recover any evidence inside."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_7:0 "The raid on the Wallonian command's safehouse has given us a biggest break yet, in the form of coded maps they were trying to to destroy as our agents barged in. Recovered in the nick of time and with only minimal fire damage, they appear to be navigation maps that are focused on the Ardennes region, with many symbols and codes we do not understand at this time. However, most of them seem to be directional, pointing towards a big structure marked simply with an X that does not appear on any of our previously recovered documents. To further look into this development, we have three options:\n\n- Find the big structure marked on the map using the directional refferences to see what it might be holding/\n\n- Decode the legend and the various symbols in order to glean the true purpose of the maps.\n\n- Question the officers who were in possesion of it at the time of the raid in order to see if they will give up any new information."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_8:0 "Many thought he was still dead, even after we learned that his death was faked, but we now have conclusive proof that Degrelle is alive and has hidden himself away in a cmoplex located deep in the Ardennes. Nicknamed the "Lions Den" by our investigators, its existence was only known to the upper echelon of Walloon's command as well as the elite shock troops guarding it, written off as an old storage shed on the official maps of the region. According to our observers who both watch the complex day and night and have begun digging into its history, Degrelle has been there ever since his escape, commanding the legion secretly from behind its doors. He is constantly watched by a detatchment of Walloon's best and most loyal men, who swear loyalty to him personally and represent the most fearsome fighting force outside our own ranks. While there is still much we do not know, one thing is for certain: Degrelle will not go without a fight, and any attempts to put him down for good should be planned carefully."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_9:0 "A further look into Walloon's vehichle use has led to a disturbing discovery: they have aqquistioned a large number of trucks to ferry as of yet unknown supplies around their state. Mainly going to unit headquarters and supply dumps, it appears as if the convoys run every week to the same exact places, using faked orders that, on inspection, appear to be from people and officers that don't even exist. Their supply manifests too are blacked out on the reports we requested from them, which only furthers our suspicion that something is indeed going on. To look into this situation further, we have three options:\n\n- Find who authorized these operations and the faking of papers by listening in on the radio communications the next time the convoys run.\n\n- Look over the paperwork again to see if anything new can be gleaned from them.\n\n- Investigate this hidden cargo they haul to all the different supply and command posts."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_10:0 "Investigating the dissapearences and mutinies in the Walloon ranks has yeilded an interesting turn of events. It appears as if that isn't the case as first thought, but instead Walloon's leadership corps has been taking away soldiers under the radar for a new, unnaproved training regimen. They have been learning both new combat skills, with specialziations in undercover operations, and more interesting, trade skills such as manufacturing and machine shop. To look into this further, we have three options:\n\n- Observe the drills secretly to see if anything else is going on.\n\n- Question the trainers on the purpose of these exercises.\n\n- Check on the supply inventory for the program in order to find where they are getting the materials for all these programs."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_11:0 "It appears as if Walloon's men really haven't been shirking their work, but instead putting it to use in previously undisclosed factory complexes burried deep in Wallonia. Using their new industrialized training, these former foot soldiers are officially stationed in the facotry to "guard" them, but in fact are being put to work in order to create a new class of weapons and armements for the Legion, outside of our control. While this in itself is not an afront to our authority, the fact that Walloon wants to have its own industrial base outside of our grasp and has been lying about where their soldiers have been does not bode well for the future. To continue investigating the factories, we have three options:\n\n- Find the motive behind setting up a seperate industrial base and see if it has a greater purpose then what we know now.\n\n- Look into the distribution of all the weapons and equipment being produced to see if that leads anwyhere.\n\n- Identify the supply chain in order to identify where they are getting all their materials from."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_12:0 "Even before Degrelle's dissapearence and Thiriart's inability to lead, Walloon always had problems with morale and dedication to the Burgundian cause. However, it seems to have multiplied out of control in recent months. Men simply don't show up for drills, training, or inspections. Commanders take weeks to return calls or carry out the most mundane orders. Such flaunting of disobedience would normally be cause to purge the entire Legion from our ranks, but the mystery of Walloon's attitude problem comes from the fact that they appear to almost always be in a constant state of work. Their vehicle records show they are in use near constantly, ferrying supplies all around the legion, their commanders report (when they bother to) that their men are always busy, but it's almost like none of it is actually being done for us. Which begs the question, what are they working on? To answer that inquiry, we have three options at our disposal:\n\n- Study their recent behavior and try to pinpoint any patterns.\n\n- Investigate the dissapearences and mutinies among their men and see if it's for a greater purpose then currently thought.\n\n- Look into the vehicle use to try and figure out why they are using them so much."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_13:0 "The reason behind Thiriart's inability to control his Legion have become rapidly clear with the discovery of the latest piece of evidence: Degrelle has been communicating with his high command on a specialized and secret frequency. The only reason we know it is him is through his repeated use of his pre-dissapearence sign off, which was "retired" respectfully by the high command after the War. While we still do not know the contents of the messages Degrelle has been sending, this does confirm that he is alive and the true person in charge of the Legion, meaning they still are as a grave of a threat as earlier. To investigate this disturbing turn of events, we have three options:\n\n- Find the transmission source of Degrelle's messages so we can try and locate his whereabouts.\n\n- Look into the officers who also are on the secret channel in order to see what they might know.\n\n- Confiscate the radios connected to the network and take them apart in order to see if they are hiding anything else."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_14:0 "A look into Walloon's supply manifests have given us a peculiar find. There seems to be a massive amont of unmarked arms caches in their stockpiles, loaded with the latest weapoary and spread far and wide across the region. They are concentrated at the unit level supply dumps and only the commanding officer has the key to unlock them, but what has been the most interesing find is the explanation for when they should do just that. According to a stolen order from Walloon high command, one not signed by Thiriart, the local commanders are only supposed to distribute the weapons "when the time comes". What this means, our investigators have no idea, but it certainly does not bode well. To look into this further, we have three options:\n\n- Search the supply depots to see if anything else can be learned from them.\n\n- Find the soure of all these weapons to see if they are manufacturing anything else.\n\n- Search for more records in order to find out what and when "the time comes" is."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_15:0 "As layed out in the summary of a report on its feasability, Operation Leopold is the plan for a Walloonian revolt against the Burgundian system in order to both dispose of the Fuhrer and establish a free and independent Wallonian state. It seems as if it was only created in the aftermath of our war with France and directed by Degrelle himself from hiding, putting together the final pieces of his plans. It has become increasingly clear that Walloon is working towards the prerequisites for carrying out the Operation with great and worrying speed, stockpiling weapons and creating their own industrial base in order to have a fighting chance against our might, which means we must shut it down as soon as we can, before the situation spirals out of control. To do that, we have three options:\n\n- Bug it's authors in order to locate Degrelle, the chief architect of and the lynchpin behind the plan.\n\n- Find where the memos for the plan were made and distributed.\n\n- Investigate the officers listed as essential to the operation to see if they will give up any information, willingly or unwillingly."

"우린 SS국가지도자 각하를 만나기로 되어 있는데 왜 여기 밑에 있는 거지?" 드그렐은 어깨를 으쓱이면서 침을 뱉고 담배를 밟아 뭉갰습니다. 에릭손은 시선을 옮겨 마지에르를 내려다 보았습니다.\n\n"아이고, 너무 불쾌해하잖아, 에릭손. 그냥 물어본 것 뿐이라고." 마지에르는 자기 의자에 기대어 한숨을 쉬었습니다. 드그렐과 에릭손은 둘 다 침착한 모습이었지만 그들의 생각은 그렇지 않았습니다. 힘러가 그들을 만난다면, 그들이 왜 이런 퀴퀴한 지하실에 앉아 있겠습니까? 5분간 기다린 끝에 문이 끼익 소리를 내었습니다. SS제복을 입은 젊은 여성이 서류철 셋을 챙긴 채 들어오고 있었습니다.\n\n"여러분," 그녀는 완벽한 독일어로 말을 시작했습니다. "국가지도자께서 안부를 전하셨습니다." 그 말 뒤에 숨은 의미는 분명했습니다. 힘러가 시간을 들일만한 가치가 없다는 것이었습니다.\n\n"여러분 셋은 여기 요약한 바와 같이 중요한 임무를 부여받았습니다." 그녀는 테이블 가운데에 서류철을 떨어뜨렸습니다. "국가지도자께서는 조속히 건물 밖으로 나간 뒤에 내용을 살펴보라고 '부탁'하셨습니다. 끝입니다." 여자는 돌더니 문을 쾅 닫으며 자리를 떴습니다. 에릭손과 마지에르는 얼굴에 놀라움을 드러내며 계속 앉아 있었습니다. 드그렐은 일어서서 서류철 중 하나를 휙 집어 들고 문밖으로 나갔습니다."

"프랑스 침공."\n\n마지에르의 얼굴은 밝아졌습니다. 그는 말이 목구멍에 걸린 듯 잠시 멈춘 후 말했습니다. "이건 모든 민족주의 프랑스인들에게 기회입니다! 각하께서 이렇게 말씀해주셔서 영광입니다. 저희에게 직접 말씀하신 것을 후회하시지 않으실 것입니다..."\n\n마지에르가 아첨하기 시작하자, 국가지도자와 에릭손은 시선을 마주했습니다. 그의 눈빛은 에릭손의 피를 차갑게 식도록 만들었고, 에릭손은 횡설수설하는 사내에게 말을 걸기 위해 몸을 돌렸습니다.\n\n"마지에르, 그만해." 프랑스인 부역자는 입을 헤벌리고는 문장을 중간에서 멈추었습니다. 그의 표정은 기쁨에서 공포로 바뀌었습니다. 그는 차례차례 너무 많은 말을 했다는 사실을 깨달았습니다. 힘러는 그의 멍청한 표정을 무시하고 계속 말을 이었습니다. "두 분 다 곧 내 참모로부터 명령과 세부 사항을 받게 될 것이네. 그게 다야." 힘러는 다시 의자에 몸을 기댄 채 문을 향해 손짓을 하며 두 사람을 떨쳐냈습니다."

 BRG_expand_autobahns_desc:0 "제국 초기 아리아인의 삶의 질에 대한 총통의 가장 큰 공헌은 의심할 여지 없이 사람들이 편하게 여행할 수 있도록 하는 라이히스아우토반 건설이었습니다. 기사단국의 고속도로에서도 같은 일을 하는 것은 우리의 제조와 물류에 엄청난 이익이 될 것입니다."
 BRG_grand_plans_desc:0 "기사단국의 땅은 수천 년의 역사를 가진 땅입니다. 불행히도, 그 역사의 대부분은 타락한 유대-세계주의 사회의 통치하에 있었고, 그들의 부패는 도시의 돌과 토양에 스며들었습니다. 우리에게 진정으로 필요한 곳은 불순물을 깨끗이 닦아 국가사회주의의 선견지명을 새기는 백지같은 곳입니다."
 BRG_raze_neighbourhoods_desc:0 "역사를 살펴보면 게르만족의 패권이 로마인 율리우스 카이사르의 살해에 이은 소위 '야만족'의 패권에서 오스트리아-헝가리 제국과 프랑스 공화국보다 우월한 독일 제국의 지배력, 타락한 서방 연합국과 유대 볼셰비즘에 대항한 독일의 승리에 이르기까지 지구상에 뚜렷하게 나타나 있다는 것을 알 수 있습니다. 그러나 우리는  기사단국 내에서 점점 더 강대해지는 아리아인 사회의 큰 오점인 프랑스식 건축의 분명한 존재를 포함해 어떠한 형태의 비아리아적인 영향도 필연적인 부패가 뒤따른다는 것을 인식했습니다. 그러므로, 기사단국에서 가장 우선해야 할 사항은 이런 영향의 흔적을 없애는 것입니다. 건물, 조각, 그 총체, 각각의 세부사항 등에 역겨운 프랑스식 영향이 나타나는 것은 더 이상 허락할 수 없습니다. 기사단국은 이러한 오염에서 정화되어야 하며 필요하다면 태우거나 위조해야 합니다."
 BRG_new_era_surveilance_desc:0 "The modern age has brought about great revolutions in the technological world, thanks, in part, to the scientific advancements of the Vaterland, which have brought the world into a new era of connection and research. One of the greatest leaps in technological possibility has come through the new reaches in photographic and videographic technologies, as the rapid happenings of the modern age can now all be captured, watched, and monitored. Although the decadent capitalists of the West will claim to use such technologies for the gross "entertainment" they fetishize, and the Slav shall bear no advanced possession of this technology for decades in their broken state, it is the perfect opportunity for us to apply such technologies to monitor the possibility of corruption within our state. Aryans are the supreme masters of this world, and we shall ensure that all citizens understand that it is the Aryan state that shall watch over and protect them, at all costs."
 BRG_true_brutalist_design_desc:0 "The City of Paris remains a towering symbol for all those desperately clawing for corrupted ideals of democracy, freedom, individualism, and autonomy. The French, throughout time, stood as a direct enemy to the virtuous Aryan, attempting to tear apart any form of Western authority for the sake of their own pitiful grasps for a "free state," even as it helped allow for the birth of the United States of America. However, such bright lights can be snuffed out by the powers of the Ordensstaat, and quench this flame we shall. From the architecture of the buildings to the structure of artworks and areas of French Culture, the state shall lend its grasp to secure a brighter future. Every single miniscule inch of our public sphere shall be checked over, with our capital being rebirthed into a new age of order, law, and Aryan supremacy, above the gross weaknesses of the French who prided themselves on this formerly decadent land for centuries."
 BRG_arbeiterkultur_desc:0 "The decadence of the Reich has fostered an attitude of complacency and laziness in its Aryan citizens. If we are to avoid the twin menaces of social parasitism and decadence, we must encourage all our citizens to labor for the good of the Ordensstaat."
 BRG_industrialbezirk_rodomo_desc:0 "The city of Rouen. In the past, the city stood tall for the inbred masses of the conservative French nobility of old. There, they would convene with the ghastly corruption of the Catholic Church to celebrate their bastardized form of noble life, whilst the truly virtuous German watched from across the continent, disgusted at the actions that occurred within the disgusting pit of sin and wretchedness that was Rouen. Now, however, the city stands as a valuable asset for the Ordensstaat, as our continuous search for a potential asset to acquire in order to relieve economic pressure may have concluded in our newest, greatest plans. Every brick, tile, and cross shall be thrown away from the corrupted city, as every crack and crevice where sinfulness hides, and with it, forced labor by the unworthy shall fill its place. Rouen shall become a new source of power by which the Ordensstaat may rise, whilst the insufferable sub-humans shall work for all of our benefit."
 BRG_expand_mines_desc:0 "For millennia, mankind has toiled upon this Earth, serving his bloodline by producing whatever fruits of his labor may aid them in the ongoing crisis of their time and age. However, such themes have not withered away, as the labor of man sends them miles beneath the surface to carve out the treasures provided by the Earth, inherently destined for the use of the rightful Aryan. However, with capitalism's parasitic, murderous rampage across the markets of the modern day, the Aryan finds himself unable to benefit for his destined riches, to use for the greater glory of his blood and state. No more, however, as we shall direct state resources in order to greatly expand upon the current mines in use throughout the Ordensstaat, and opening up as many as possible in order to maximize potential gain from the land miles below our steps. No more shall the Aryan claim an inability to provide service towards his state, as any and all shall find themselves within reach of a mineshaft, reaching to unearth the pleasures of the cores of this world."
 BRG_forced_relocation_desc:0 "What once was the corrupted and unholy French land of Rouen has become the industrial powerhouse we have dreamed it to be, in revolutionizing the area to become Rodomo, one of the largest and most economically powerful lands of the Ordensstaat. Everyday, the lesser men and women of this accursed world toil beneath their Aryan masters, working to ensure a new dawning for power within the world as our economy grows and climbs, fending off any treasonous warnings of implosion. However, whilst Rodomo has already pleased those in power reigning over the new industrious KZ-Lager throughout the city of Rodomo, standing idle to its growth will prove to be its downfall. Instead, we shall take the initiative by relocating sections of the Ordensstaat's populace to reside inside of Rodomo, propping up several new areas of residence, and allowing these new arrivals to work diligently, for the greater glory of all Aryan-kind."
 BRG_factories_of_their_destruction_desc:0 "When examining the lives of lesser beings, one could look onto their lives as slaves as being a sort of mercy to them. Whilst extermination would be the most desirable outcome for them on account of all parties involved, a life of slavery allows them to participate in the growing successes of the masters of this world, toiling every waking hour for our greater success, until they eventually die out, as it would be destined for them. For anything less would allow this world to be grafted with further corruption, as showcased within the Americas, where Judeo-Bolshevik democracies and capitalistic tendencies let them tear each other apart, like rival families of rats in a sewage pipe. Today, they shall find themselves growing more useful, however: today, we will begin the mass relocation of undesirable slaves towards Rodomo in order to construct larger and more numerous factories, where these slaves shall live, where they shall work, and where they shall die."
 BRG_work_is_freedom_desc:0 " Many good Aryan men have used the intelligence their genetics have blessed them with, unlike the other mutated scum of this Earth, to ponder the reasons for which the Reich failed, where we have begun to succeed. Some say political rivalries, some say economic failures, but we truly know why: devotion, or a lack thereof. Germans were not dedicated enough to their blood-home, to the place where they earned the spotlight as the true inheritors of world power. And, regarding our infrastructural projects, we shall not lack any form of devotion which cursed the Reich. Every slave will work, every man, woman, and child shall find place to work inside Rodomo, and both Aryan and undesirable will find themselves serving the Ordensstaat. If a limb gives out? Cut it off. If another man falls? He will be butchered as the weak swine he is. KZ-Lager Rodomo will rise. We shall rise."
 BRG_rohstoffamt_desc:0 "The management of all mines, wells, rigs, and refineries in the Ordensstaat is run haphazardly, with local gauleiters allowed to make their own rules and set their own management policies as they see fit in any scenario. This lack of oversight and organization is incredibly dangerous, and may be exploited by Jewish elements in order to completely cripple the Ordensstaat's economy in our hour of need. There needs to be a system to manage them, and soon."
 BRG_totalstandardisierung_desc:0 "Although we have done a wonderful job of unifying the complex system of French, Belgian, pre-war and post-war Reich standards in science, manufacturing, and infrastructure, there are still some areas that have not been fully adapted. There shall be one standard, an official standard set by the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office, that will handle all official industrial measurements. And it will be followed."
 BRG_expanded_mining_equipment_desc:0 "The economy which allows us to carry out the will of the Reichsführer-SS throughout the lands of the Ordensstaat finds success within the very fruits born from the world itself, gifts for the modern Aryan man. Of course, the decadent Frenchman who ruled over these lands for centuries found no use in striking the Earth, and truly delving into their economic potential, as the greedy tentacles of capitalistic, decadent slothfulness constrained and choked any form of potential success out of the French. However, upon the stone and earth by which the Gaul fell, the Aryan shall find prosperity, as it shall become our economic priority to claw into the land which bears jewels, gold, and other treasures that shall stoke the flame fueling the Ordensstaat. The outdated, broken down equipment shall be replaced with the most advanced mining operative equipment available to us, as the Ordensstaat shall find wealth in these ashen lands."
 BRG_uranium_zentralmassiv_desc:0 "The Zentralmassiv, the highlands of southern France, have an untapped geological potential that was never exploited to its fullest extent by the foolish French government. Deep beneath the surface are veins of uranium ore, just waiting to be mined, refined, and put to a far more noble purpose. Although it is not a massive department that can sustain an expansive nuclear program for years, it will most certainly do for now."
 BRG_atom_in_our_hands_desc:0 "Warfare has become conceptually intertwined with the very nature of humanity, and in this perpetuating growth upon human nature, the Aryan spirit has expressed this intertwining more masterfully than ever before. It was the supposed Germanic "barbarians" who brought down the cesped of sin that was the Roman Empire, and it was the Aryan who brought the Dragon of the United States of America and the rest of the democratic world to kneel before us through the might of atomic warfare. And now, finally, the true Aryans of this world shall regain control over the masterful power of atomic weaponry, after the cowardly traitors of the Reich became too feeble to handle the immense might of such arms. We shall direct our efforts into constructing reactors capable of producing the components needed to manufacture nuclear weapons of our own, and propel the Aryan's ability for war far further than the world could ever know, by the will of the Reichsführer-SS."
 BRG_expanding_our_reach_desc:0 "Our work to ensure a greater future for the Ordensstaat has been realized through the winding camps and countless smokestacks rising above the former city of Rouen, where the French would gather to fetishize the disgusting ways of French Catholic nobility. Now, all that stands is the great working place of Rodomo, where subhumans find their true purpose in endless work to support their masters, whilst the common Aryan finds his place to exercise the strength of Aryan genetics through dedication to the state. However, it is time for us to capitalize upon the newfound strength through the benefits of KZ-Lager Rodomo, and it is time to serve the Reichsführer-SS's vision through our economic bolsterings from a greater form of infrastructure. Examining the countless plans and operations planned out for the operatives within the Schutzstaffel-Außenpolitisches AMT and applying our new assets from our emboldened infrastructure will allow us to succeed unlike anything seen before."
 BRG_unsavory_friends_desc:0 " the aftermath of the Second World War, the Vaterland proved to be the reigning force of Western Civilization. No more was the contention between the French and their supposed "enlightenment," not the Anglos and their attempted grasps at glory, gold, and their God. Now, only Aryans proved to be masters of this domain; however, as with all the Reich has lost, so too did this dominance slip, and eventually lead to outbreaks of freedom and autonomy, such as that of the Brittanians. Now, the rats operate as the greatest spread of corruption and black market operations on this hemisphere; however, to say they are completely useless would be an underestimate of their abilities. In recognizing the entirety of the state having operated as a giant illegal marketplace, our newly forged economic and infrastructural strength can be connected to this marketplace, allowing our operations to benefit through the routes provided by the Brittanians. Of course, any other option would be preferable than working with scum, but the virtuous Aryan must work with what it can in this putrid world."
 BRG_expanded_pipeline_desc:0 "In echo-chamberist think tanks revolving around Judeo-Bolshevik, liberalized "intellectuals," one may find many regarding words, essays, treatises, and documents to be that which changes the world, to be the true source of power and might in this short lifetime. However, the truly grand Aryan recognizes a separate idea, a truth amidst lies of pacifistic traitors: that being the might of the Sword, the weapons that Aryans wield in order to wage war and exterminate the vermin which seeks to stand against the true strength of Germanic society. In this idea, our newly forged partnerships with illicit marketers and smugglers of all kind operating throughout Brittanian society has allowed ourselves to come into means to truly spread the might of the sword across the world. In this idea, we shall use this pipeline to our benefit, and spread arms forged from the Ordensstaat to our operations across the globe, allowing the world to be pushed further and further into conflict. Additionally, we shall find great benefit to the Ordensstaat's economy in doing so, aiding the Reichsführer-SS all the while."
 BRG_our_benevolent_help_desc:0 "The strength of the Ordensstaat has come from order. The prosperity of the Ordensstaat has come from vigilance. Now, the growth of the Ordensstaat shall come from perseverance. Everyday, the corruption of our world grows stronger and stronger, finding new ways to prop up fantastical ideas of individualistic autonomy or a concept of a free market to attempt to skew mankind into bending to the will of the Judeo-Bolshevik. However, we shall turn this constant stream of decadence against itself, as the goods of the Ordensstaat shall spread throughout all corners of the globe through the Brittanian market. To do this, however, we mustn't allow ourselves to believe that we can simply let the system run upon itself, lest we seek to follow down the path of the traitorous Reich. Rather, the halls of workshops and factories filled to the rats that are subhumans shall further increase production, as the concept of 100% increases fade into the past and the direction of our economy reaches into destiny."
 BRG_our_own_hands_desc:0 "With the gross nature of the world the Aryan man has been forced to inhabit, one could assume that it would be impossible for those of virtue to avoid such grasping hands as that of the Judeo-Bolshevik or that of the Capitalist scum. However, despite this harmful assumption, the Aryan man has driven far above and beyond the worry of such delving into corruption and decadence, guaranteeing a Germanic future above all else. However, despite this guarantee of Aryan supremacy, we must ensure that we do not falter and allow ourselves to remain even potentially close to any form of disgrace. Whether it be the Brittanians, the Swiss, or any other potential European parasites that seek to suck the blood out of the Ordensstaat itself, we must sever the wrapping tentacles of corruption coming from such "alliances" and distance ourselves as so. Instead, the Ordensstaat shall learn to operate independently, without the need of other states to guarantee its success, by blood if need be."
 BRG_develop_hafenstadt_desc:0 "The Ordensstaat is severely lacking in a functioning blue water navy. Compounded with a lack of dockyard facilities, our ship production is woefully inadequate for the Reichsführer's plans. To right this inexcusable wrong, the key port city of Hafenstadt has been selected for a series of massive expansions to its port facilities.\n\nThe benefits will be twofold. Firstly, and most importantly, our shipbuilding capabilities will be vastly increased. Having a force capable of defending our coasts, and the capability to build our own ships and patrol our waters is of the utmost importance to the Staat. Of little consequence is the slums that must be razed to proceed with construction."
 BRG_burgundian_shipyards_desc:0 "While progress on our dockyards have proceeded as planned, our shipbuilding output is still well below what the Reichsführer demands from the ports. It has therefore been decided to send slaves en-mass into the dockyards to increase production. The docks will operate twenty-four hours a day, and further expansion to our already impressive facilities is planned and underway. Any measures that can be enacted to further increase production efficiency, like breaks and safety measures has been completely done away with. For twelve straight hours a day, our laborers will toil to build us a presence on the ocean!"
 BRG_fist_tightened_desc:0 "Our efforts to invest in our infrastructure has finally borne fruit. Slaves across the Ordensstaat toil for the master race in our new factories, with little respite. The chain-gangs have finished construction of the mines in which they now labor in. The dockyards are filled to the brim with our servants, and even now Ordensstaat arms make their way to Brittany where our supplies are sold, only to sow the seeds of chaos elsewhere in the world.\n\nAs an added boon, our control over the wider population is total. What little "free time" the untermenschen have to themselves is spent eating, sleeping, then making the journey back to their assigned jobs. Pure Aryans watch their every move at our work camps and facilities, though by and large the population is too exhausted just surviving to take up active (though futile) resistance against the Staat.\n\nThe development of the Ordensstaat is more or less complete. The Reichsführer is pleased with the outcome."
 BRG_fuel_of_progress_desc:0 "Oil! What a wondrous substance, powering the modern age, all the relentless engines of progress. Oil fueled the tanks that crushed Europe beneath their tracks, heats our barracks, fuels the cars that roar along the autobahn, and fuels the trains that carry the degenerates to our camps. But Burgundy is sadly short on it, and with our increasing isolation from the Reich at large we find ourselves in an ever escalating shortage. The Pakt in general is having its own problems with oil supply, so we cannot rely on our usual contacts in the black market to fully cover our needs. A solution must be found so the gods of the new age are starved of the sweet nectar of their victory!"
 BRG_found_olberschaffungsburo_desc:0 "To ensure a steady supply of oil, the WVHA have ordered the formation of an Oil Acquisition Bureau under Office W. We must immediately organize a crack team of geologists, economists and diplomats to appraise how to attain the black gold."
 BRG_going_under_curtain_desc:0 "Our normal black market contacts may not be able to provide us with much in the way of oil, but it is not like oil is only found in Europe. Vast reserves exist in the Middle East and Americas. Perhaps our friends in Nantes can organize some mutually beneficial arrangement?"
 BRG_small_opening_of_border_desc:0 "The Chief Executive Officer of Wintershall in Germany proper is a personal friend of the Reichsführer from back in the early forties. If we cut a deal to allow Wintershall, and only Wintershall, to export oil to the Burgundian market which has been closed to German oil firms since the Civil War, Wintershall would make a nice profit and we would acquire a source of oil that is still trusted to not spill our secrets."
 BRG_funnel_through_brettons_desc:0 "Our friends in Brittany have come through and found us another potential oil seller! A major landowner and plantation baron in Venezuela happens to own several rich oil fields he has not informed the government about, seeking to make an untaxed profit from a discreet buyer. Well, there's nobody more discreet than us. "
 BRG_pressure_nordsee_desc:0 "Our Norwegian contacts from the Quisling incident have informed us that Terboven's government suspected the presence of significant oil reserves in the North Sea, and our Wintershall friends have let slip some documents that confirm German oil firms based in England and Denmark have identified several promising fields. We just need to exert some diplomatic pressure on Norwegian officials and pretend we have the backing of Germania, and they are sure to allow a "Breton" oil company to take part in the development of oil rigs in the North Sea. "
 BRG_burgundian_oil_rigs_desc:0 "The Brittany-Registered ChannelOil company has just opened its first proper oil rigs in the North Sea. We even gave it an English name so that anyone looking closely enough to notice it is a front company will only suspect one of the big American firms. Only actual interviews with the crews would reveal a mix of old Shell drillers and younger Wintershall experts, and we've made very sure that neither the Breton nor Norwegian government will ever question the crews."
 BRG_norman_pipeline_desc:0 "Moving the black market oil on trucks was straining enough before, but now with the increased influx our transport capacity has been stretched to the limit. As such, the Olberschaffunsburo have recommended the construction of a ChannelOil receiving port on the Breton side of our shared border, and then the laying of an underground pipeline through Normandy to our refineries northeast of Paris. The so-called Norman Pipeline will be a very large and difficult project to hide from spy planes, but once complete we will have a secure stream of oil, running right into our refineries from the Outside World without them even knowing.

This will allow the state to build up its strategically fuel reserves to a more acceptable level. One never knows when he'll need more black gold..."
 BRG_synthethische_kraffstoffproduktion_desc:0 "Aryan science is the envy of the world! Why then, should we spend our hard earned capitol on foreign petrol when we can invest that money here in our own research centers?\n\nInstead of buying oil overseas, we could be making our own! Aryan ingenuity is not to be underestimated; by focusing our research and development efforts on synethictly producing petroleum and other hydrocarbons, we can further reduce our dependence on the global market."
 BRG_study_bergius_production_desc:0 "Our top researchers are convinced that they can perfect the Bergius Process. There are three different processes that our men can use to make petrol; a heavy oil process, a lighter, medium oil process, and finally the gasoline method. If we were to do all of this production on one site rather than separate ones as we have been doing, we could greatly cut down on our waste and transportation costs, since the waste from the separate processes can be recycled and used for others! Our scientists are optimistic that they can increase our coal liquefaction carbon efficiency to 95%, provided the Staat assists with funding."
 BRG_look_into_rubber_desc:0 "Oil resin has a myriad of uses pertaining to industrial uses. Plastics, adhesives, sealants, paint, and more all need resin as a base. More important than all of this, however, is rubber. Using our leftover petrol resins, this waste from our refining can be used to synthesize our own rubber products. Our scientists say that, with a little 'optimization', we can get more out of what we've been producing so far.\n\nThe importance of increasing our rubber yields can NOT be understated. Rubber is a necessary good; without it, production of vital military goods is simply impossible. If we are to achieve Autarky, we must increase our pitifully low yields of rubber. For the good of the Ordensstaat, increasing our rubber output needs to be a priority."
 BRG_integrate_rodomo_facilities_desc:0 "We have lazy degenerates lazing around in our camps. Our Staat also lacks oil and synthetic rubber. As our fathers would say, we should kill "two birds with one stone."\n\nWe can mobilize slave laborers and subject them to brutal working conditions and hours to quickly build more oil refineries. The human cost will likely be significant if we are to build these expediently. The people in question are also untermensch; their lives are forfeit and of no consequence."
 BRG_expand_operations_desc:0 "The Reichsführer demands more. Our output, even after these last months, is still "woefully inadequate." It's time to ramp up our production even further.\n\nOther small crude oil reserves? We're going to drill them. We have more; many more; hundreds of thousands of untermensch just wasting away in our camps. Unacceptable, they are to be mobilized and put to work building, then working in new refineries across the Staat. The Reichsführer isn't content to just let our own Aryans stand by; any of our own men with technical experience of any kind should be temporarily assigned to construction details."
 BRG_ration_usage_desc:0 "In an attempt to save more fuel for our own uses, the Staat shall introduce strict rationing. Anyone who is not an Aryan or one of our collaborators will be ineligible to receive motor oil or fuel. Furthermore, all citizens who have access to petrol will be limited to how much they can receive, based on their importance to the Ordensstaat. Though many will not like it, no one will dare complain. This is, after all, for the good of the Staat. Through personal sacrifice comes victory."
 BRG_no_more_generosity_desc:0 "The collaborators are not Aryans. They will never be; they are merely tools that we use to further our own goals. They have become complacent, fat, lazy. Only by our good graces are they and their families not in camps, and they know this well.\n\nSetting strict rationing on the collaborators has two main benefits. It'll put the collaborators in their place, so to speak. We don't want them to forget that they work for us, not the other way around. They're expendable, and do not want to fall out of favor with us. The added benefit of more oil for the Staat is not to be overlooked, however. The Reichsführer demands more fuel for our war industry, and we will, of course, comply."
 BRG_survey_campaigns_desc:0 "Taking inventory of our overall oil output is not reassuring. The Ordensstaat, as of now, simply does not have the capabilities to supply the Staat with enough oil to be self-sufficient The. Reichsführer demands we resolve the issue at once. The Ordensstaat's energy independence and self sufficiency is vital for the survival and wellbeing of the Staat.\n\nIt is well known that there are plentiful natural gas reserves in the Netherlands; therefore it isn't a stretch that there could very well be more oil in the Ordensstaat that we haven't discovered yet. Therefore, the Reichsführer has ordered a vast survey campaign to be conducted throughout our holdings to find untapped oil reserves for our thirsty war machine."
 BRG_oil_wells_of_paris_basin_desc:0 "Our surveyors have come back with most welcome news; underneath the nerve-center of the Staat lays the black gold we so desperately need. The Paris Basin is a surprising discovery, but certainly a most welcome one. Being so close to several metropolitan areas, it is a trivial matter to resquite the required laborers for processing this vital resource.\n\nOf course, we need to set up the required heavy equipment for extraction. Drills, piping, pumps, and more all need to be shipped (or dragged, if need be) to our new construction sites. The labor will be intense and long, but the Reichsführer demands results. Our self-sufficiency is of the utmost importance for our final goal."
 BRG_produce_liquefied_coal_desc:0 "Our newfound oil reservoirs are not sufficient for the Reichsführer. Our oil output is still not high enough for the Staat to achieve Autarky; we need MORE. However, there is a way to increase our output even more.\n\nAn ambitious plan has been laid on the table; the Reich, during our great struggle against the Allied Powers and the Soviet Union faced a similar lack of petrol. However, German ingenuity found a way, as always. Coal, after grueling and tedious work, can be turned into liquified into motor oil and fuel. The process is not as efficient as simply extracting crude oil, but it will increase our petrol output nonetheless."
 BRG_prime_pumps_desc:0 "Now that our petrol output is up to acceptable numbers, it is time we invest in increasing our strategic reserves.\n\nFor years now, we never had the need for large scale holding tanks; we simply never had that much oil on hand to warrant expanding our storage capabilities. Times are quickly changing however. The Ordensstaat is loath to waste any excess petrol we produce, and the Reichsführer demands action. We'll call up the masses and build new, massive holding tanks for our newly found wealth."
 BRG_worth_its_weight_in_gold_desc:0 "Black gold. The life blood of our industry; the fuel that drives our panzers, that propels our transports, and which allows our armed forces to be ready for anything at a moments notice. We have this liquid gold, and we have it in abundance now. Our reserves are quickly filling up thanks to the massive amount of effort we diverged towards energy independence, to the Reichsführer's approval. With our industrial base, we now lack for nothing. We are not reliant on the global market anymore. Our domestic production and austerity has finally proved to be enough, for even now we store more and more. A vital part of our plan has finally come to fruition."

This state's rightful domain—our state's rightful domain—extends from the Rhine to the Channel, and from the North Sea to the Alps. For many years now, this region, though geographically cohesive, has been divided between a plurality of countries and peoples, some superior to others. It is our moral duty as the most superior of all of these arbitrarily disparate identities to collect together and racially purify the inhabitants of the region; to make Burgundy the best, most pure and distilled, and most strong version of itself as it has ever been.

The Charlemagne Legion in particular is perhaps too proud of their French ancestry. They must be made to always remember that they are each and every one of them Burgundians, not Frenchmen. Perhaps thinning their numbers of the least truehearted of them might encourage the rest to be more forthright in their devotion to the Aryan race."
 BRG_search_for_professors_desc:0 "Essential to the rendering of the French and other indigenous peoples into a great Burgundian mass is the incorporation of the prominent figures among them who have earned the trust of the Reichsführer-SS into positions of prestige.

They must look on the faces of those they knew to be French who now proudly call themselves Burgundian, and they must admire and wish to emulate all those faces that they see. This shall be doubly true in the realm of academia—it will be difficult for a French student in Paris to deny that his people are best served as denizens of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund when all of his trusted professors heart-warmingly proclaim as such.

They have earned for themselves only the flame. All that remains is to decide precisely which books, by precisely which proscribed writers, ought to be made non-existent.

If every former Frenchman from Calais to the Haut-Jura had the mind of Mabire, the project of reeducating the people would be complete.\n\nIt would only make sense to allow this exemplar to aid in the conscription of his compatriots to the good cause we fight for, that they might come to share his enthusiasm for we who "carry Sigurd's sword and the Prometheus torch".

Let every pupil in every school read and remember the wise words of Mabire."
 BRG_authenitiziat_desc:0 "To become something more than a splinter state of the Reich, the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund must be faithful to itself and to what it holds dear. The state and its people must be as one in their defiance against the persistent influences of Bolshevik and American plutocratic ideas—but also to the idea that we are merely an extension of our eastern neighbour. The foreign ideologies of all those who exist beyond our bounds are a cancer to the heart and lungs of the Burgundian personhood, infesting our insides and weakening us from where we are least equipped to fight back. The only way to prevent these spiritual tumors from overwhelming us is to excise them, without pause or mercy. We are not French, we are Burgundian—to say otherwise is anathema and to be forbidden. We do not belong to the Reich, we belong to the Reichsführer-SS—to say otherwise is anathema and to be forbidden. Every man, woman and child within the boundaries of our state must be entirely loyal to our state alone and to the humanity saving ideology of National Socialism to which it adheres.

 BRG_our_germanic_hertiage_desc:0 "The empire of the Franks that grew from what is now the Ordensstaat conquered itself west and east and became the predecessor of two brother nations: Germany, and France. These two countries' sibling rivalry would be the primary feature of the history and politics of Western Europe for over a millenia. Through the many wars fought between these brothers, they cultivated a sense of themselves as something necessarily opposed to one another; they became defined by their mutual opposition, and mutual hatred, to each other. The day the SS raised their flag over the realm of Burgundy, the birthplace of the brother nations of Western Europe, was the beginning of the final days of this petty rivalry. The Führer's victory over the West Franks might have been a lasting one, which answered forever the winner of the brother's quarrel, but now the time has come for the animosity to be set aside, and for victor and defeated alike to recognize their common Germanic heritage. The descent of the French from the same conquerors that spawned the ancestral precursor states of the Reich belies the ability of the French to be incorporated into our new reich, if we should but will it to be so."
 BRG_french_are_not_german_desc:0 "Regardless, we do not desire it. The prospect of the assimilation of such a massive quantity of bodies into a new nationhood, one which they identify themselves by their opposition to, is a prospect too daunting to warrant. We are a powerful state with armies and weapons that frighten to cowardice all enemies who would dare to stand against us, but we are not workers of miracles. Our resources are better spent on maintaining our strength and security and on improving our access to important food and oil products—not on grandiose designs of convincing every French peasant not to call himself a Frenchman anymore. It is loyalty and effective, diligent labour that we expect from our people. It does not make any difference that some of the workers might speak in their indigenous tongues, so long as the words they utter are not ones of sedition."
 BRG_our_brothers_the_french_desc:0 "And so it shall be. Once we accept the fact that we are long lost brothers, it is beyond sanity to accept anything less than our full reunification. The same Burgundy whose wide plains once created the French and the Germans shall now see them become one and the same again. The ancestors of those Burgundians of old, the Charlemagnes of the history books, will look upon us from the heaven of warriors and smile that all their children shall now labour together for common cause. National Socialism in service of the Burgundian nation, not the German or French ones, is the policy of our state. The Ordensstaat serves only its own people and the goals that benefit itself, and the designs of its great leader. We are not sons of the Reich: the Reich is a son of ours."
 BRG_our_lineage_secured_desc:0 "We have toiled many hours and expended many of our resources in men, materiel and time to ensure that the future lineage of the Ordensstaat is safe and secured. At long last, our toils have come to an end. The people are being taught the truth of the world they observe around them and what happens beyond it, and the natives of the lands we have rightfully conquered have shown some evidence of coming around to the right point of view. Concrete improvements are not of importance here, so it is of little worry that we do not observe many. What is important in truth is that our lineage, the most crucial of all things, is secured for generations to come. As generations pass we can only grow purer and stronger, and as the years go on, every soul across the Ordensstaat will eventually be saved and brought around to National Socialism and to the supremacy of the Aryan race.\n\nWe have purified our bloodline. We've won."
 BRG_a_second_attempt_desc:0 "Any pretense of gently nudging the people of what was once France into subservience to our will must be removed from our efforts. They have proven themselves a waste of time. There are no more half-measures or suggestions to be made: only concrete actions and iron-clad commands. If the French will not speak German because a book told them that they should, then we shall replace the books with guns. Strict quotas for Germanization will be delivered to school precincts across the state, and penalties issued not only to non-complying settlements, but also to the enforcers that fail to produce results within them. French shall be less spoken and the nation of France less revered step by step every year until both numbers eventually reach zero. Whenever the mandated quantity of self-identifying French nationals and French speakers fails to reach the required benchmark, it shall no longer be the job of educators to make the numbers match the targets, but instead the job of the Einsatzgruppen. Addition through subtraction is their specialty."
 BRG_atompshere_of_degeneracy_desc:0 "We had thought that we could adapt the French education system and alter their curriculums to turn their pupils into the loyal Burgundians of tomorrow. Little did we know how far deep down the rot of degeneracy reaches in these institutions, lest the mistakes would never have been made. To rectify the issue, the education system will not be overhauled: it will be replaced. Community schools on street corners in major cities and towns will be shut down, their facilities used for compulsory weekly reeducation of French speaking adults. Weekend classes in German will replace forays to the cafe in the calendars of the French working class.\n\nFor the young ones, an expansive system of mandatory boarding schools will likely prove much more effective in moulding their young minds into loyal future citizens than the old . Only the most fanatically loyal of the French school teachers will be allowed to participate in the education process in these boarding schools, and the gaps left by them will be filled by military instructors. Harsh corporal punishment will be the penalty for any pupil caught speaking French in these boarding facilities, and correspondence from parents and other relatives will be screened to ensure that is both written in the German language and reflects moral fortitude and loyalty to the Schutzstaffel. The next generation WILL be purer than the last. We will make sure of it."
 BRG_a_culture_of_weakness_desc:0 "Tearing up the entire system root and stem is senselessly destructive and does not produce the ends that we design. Instead, we should change the system to the maximum possible extent at which it will still function, and engineer it to induce the Germanization of its students, above all other goals. The reasoning for this is quite simple—education's function is not in making the people more intelligent. The function of the system is in making the people conform.\n\nWe could produce the change we are looking for by directly removing the people we no longer want, but there is waste inherent in that. Every person walking in Burgundy who is racially and biologically fit to one day become a German should be treated as a future German: a lost German, as it were, one who needs to be reformed into the best possible version of himself. Naturally, this process will not only apply to the youth. Social advancement and the best paying and most skilled positions in all fields will be limited to those with proficient knowledge of the German language, and free classes in this most perfect of surviving languages will be offered to any upwardly mobile Frenchman who wishes for it. Those that don't wish for it will be under close observation until they do."
 BRG_our_ideals_are_forever_desc:0 "Plants and animals alike do not grow to their strongest and largest under supposedly optimal conditions. Too easy an access of water and food at too little effort to the organism reduces its ability to resist disease and predators. The strongest men are forged in the hottest fires, and a cold snap does not truly weaken a crop, only removing the weakest of its number and leaving the best progeny to continue on to the next generation. These facts have been known to ancient peoples for thousands of years, as practiced by the Spartans of ancient Hellas who left their sickly babes to die, and to the Aryan inventors of agriculture in the once temperate northern fringes of Scandinavia, who prayed to their gods for the cold to come and kill the weakest of the seeds in their plots. The knowledge of past generations has been lost to the liberal west, and its tendrils even sneak into the unguarded openings of the Reich itself—but the Ordensstaat will forever remain pure."
 BRG_no_more_second_chances_desc:0 "Some disloyal scoundrels who have festered in the SS as parasites inside a host have insisted that the Germanization rates we mandated onto them as governors of the towns and cities were unreasonable and unrealistic. Many indigenous French community leaders agreed, and petitioned their local authorities to allow the persistence of the French language by those who professed loyalty to the SS. None of those people who protested their orders or petitioned for leniency continue to do so today, and neither shall those who resist our efforts at Germanization continue to do so for very long.\n\nPossession of nationalist French paraphernalia shall be considered an act of treason. Public display of French signage shall be considered an act of treason. Failure to meet basic German language literacy shall also be considered an act of treason. KZ-lager shall be the only places left where French shall be heard spoken."
 BRG_destroy_it_all_desc:0 "If a stricter treatment exists, then that treatment should always be the one applied. Our destruction of resistors to Germanization has so far been too ad hoc. We have identified them as they emerged and proceed to punish them and their abettors. This process fails because it relies on the occurrence of treason in order for us to punish it. This is illogical. The better solution is to be proactive.\n\nIt isn't enough for restaurants displaying French signage to replace their signs with German ones. The restaurant should be burned down, and its owner executed. It isn't enough for an employer secretly allowing his workers to speak French at the workplace to be terminated. He must be terminated after witnessing the termination of the employees whose treason he assisted in. We are not brutish savages; we do not kill for the pleasure of ending a life, or to induce pain in those whose lives we end. We kill because some people do not deserve to live, and the widest possible definition of 'some people' results in the greatest possible state."
 BRG_salt_the_earth_desc:0 " Even as our efforts are always continuing, this heightened period of our campaign against the French language in the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is at an end. As the last act of our plan (besides the continuing Germanization quotas), it is time for a symbolic measure of the accomplishment of our program to be conducted. The Louvre, that famous work of architectural art that houses within it a collection of other French art pieces, shall be demolished. Once the rubble is cleared, a replacement will be built, to house those of the pieces inside that conform to our artistic standards. The new Louvre shall be built in the same neo-classical architectural style as is the capital of the Vaterland, in Germania. Similar destructions and reconstructions will be enacted all across the Ordensstaat, to finalize the completion of the cultural conversion of the country. Notre-Dame, too, shall be converted from a cathedral into a museum of ancient European religion, its Christian iconography removed and replaced with images of German warriors of myth. Only a small number of sites of particular importance to German history, such as the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles, will be kept unchanged. France's cultural history will be torn down and made new in the image we deem most fit. The reactions of the people will serve to test the truth of their loyalty."
 BRG_keep_them_in_our_grasp_desc:0 "It is acceptable for this generation of unskilled labourers in the Ordensstaat to continue to speak indigenous languages. However, incumbent upon the speaking of those languages is the necessity of participating in additional political programming—in the French language—to ensure that the Francophones of our state do not speak French out of disloyalty. More important than imminent Germanization is the continued stability of our state, after all. It would be insane to prioritize rapid Germanization over long-term stability. It is a choice in which either option benefits us. The people shall either become German, or shall become more politically inclined to our program. A win-win for the SS."
 BRG_get_inside_their_heads_desc:0 "Instead of being banned, French language radio broadcasts and popular culture will be used to extensively propagandize the Schutzstaffel, and to endear the French people to their new overlords. Where capitalist states would advertise their consumer goods between broadcasts, we will advertise National Socialism, and extol the virtues of our system and its multitude of accomplishments to the listening Francophone public. Everything they will see or hear in French will exist to advance the causes of the Reichsführer-SS. The same tongue that their ancestors fought and died in their number to ensure would always be spoken will be used against them to convince them of the truth they know in their hearts but have not yet accepted: that they are not so far removed from the people who they once reviled as their enemy, and that the system pioneered in the Reich and now practiced in the Ordensstaat is the best system to suit the needs of the French people."
 BRG_make_an_example_desc:0 "A program of exemplars shall be established, to give the Frenchmen living within the Ordensstaat a new system of local leaders to look up to and heroes to idolize. Those French-speaking workers among their community who are most productive will have their faces and accomplishments displayed on posters for all to see, and their families will receive preferential housing equal to German speakers, as well as social privileges and higher skilled employment to fit. Furthermore, the people of Paris will be made to forget the reigns of the Sun King and Napoleon, and remember instead the achievements of Charles Martel and Charlemagne—their oldest and greatest ancestors, the ones who truly founded France, and were closest to what the country was intended to be. New archeological excavations of the burial sites of these great men have revealed previously unknown secrets about their lifestyles. They lived simply, eating only what they needed to stay strong, and were exceptionally physically fit, and German-looking in their skeletal structure. Truly, heroes for all of us to aspire to become."

BRG_education.1.t:0 "A Lovely Dessert"
BRG_education.1.d:0 "Dr. Cäsar blinked furiously, his eyes struggling to adjust to the sudden bright bluish sheen of electrical lights somewhere over his head. He had hoped he would see more clearly once the sack was removed from his head, but the room remained blurry; to his annoyance he realized his glasses must have fallen off when the SD officers fetched him from his townhouse in Paris, dressed in little but slippers and a bathrobe. Still, even if the seven hour drive had not been hint enough, what he could make out of the room in which he found himself made it clear he most likely was no longer in the Haupstad... Grey walls, most likely concrete, and a vaulted ceiling with straight, angular corners. Cäsar had experienced his share of air raids during the last Weltkrieg; even a glorified school administrator like himself could recognize a fortified bunker room. Could this be one of the Alpenfestung he had heard discussed in the rare meeting of the SS leadership they bothered inviting him to? Even before the War, the Reichsführer had been stripping him of authority, and these days... A sudden sound of metal on porcelain startled him, and Cäsar whirled around to locate the source of the sound behind him. He almost slipped on something, his slippers failing to grip the surface, but Cäsar instantly lost all interest in the cause when he recognized the blurry outline of a man in black uniform eating a dish. A vague smell of apple settled the matter. Only one person would dare indulge in such a luxury as an apfelstrudel in front of someone of Dr. Cäsar's rank. His arm was extending before he even finished turning, his aging lungs making the loudest "HEIL HIMMLER!" they could manage. The Reichsführer SS put down his spoon and began talking softly, the rounded edges of an Upper Bavarian accent and reassuring tone hiding a barely constrained anger only somebody who had known him for as long as Cäsar could recognize. He spoke of the New Territories, of how the men of Charlemagne were undermining the civilizing mission of the Ordensstaat. Of how educational reform had failed, of how the head of untermensch education had just admitted to failing to address these issues, betraying both Dr. Cäsar and the Ordensstaat. He spoke of Cäsars three decades of loyal service and his absolute trust in him to put things right. For twenty minutes he spoke, his fidgeting underling fixated like a prey upon a snake, trying to ignore the fluid seeping through his slippers. When the Reichsführer got up to leave, Cäsar finally allowed himself a glance down. The puddle he was standing in was indeed red, peppered with white skull fragments. A parting line from the Reichsführer snapped his attention back up. "

BRG_education.2.d:0 "Dr. Cäsar observed with relief the installation of the sign announcing the reopening of der Erinnerungshalle SS, the former Panthéon in West-Paris. It was the last major monument to be renamed in the newly occupied Parisian sector. When the SS-WVHA announced that they would begin renaming streets and monuments in commemoration of the Western Security Expansion and the liberation of the peoples there from the corrupt French regime, Cäsar had been more worried than he had ever been since his meeting with the Reichsführer. While in and of itself renaming streets, towns and monuments was nothing new in the Ordensstaat, this was the first time it was done to this extent in such a short time. In just a few weeks, thousands of names had been changed in hundreds of towns all across the new territories and even in some parts of the old that had been left alone thus far, earning the barely concealed ire of millions of Frenchmen. And whose name was front and center in the propaganda surrounding the renamings, who was brought out to hold speeches at all the major renamings? Certainly not the head of the WVHA; he had buggered off the Renaming Committee the second he realized how unpopular this was going to be with both the lower classes and the Charlemagne division. That left Dr. Cäsar, head of the SS Office for Education and Culture, the SuKA, as the highest ranked member on the committee. The SuKA was already unpopular enough because of its announcement of new educational reforms to promote Germanic culture in the new regions of the Ordensstaat, and with the "disappearance" of the secretary for untermensch education, Cäsar had nobody to take the blame off him until the Hauptamt appointed somebody new. \n\nOnce he finished a short speech and shaking hands with the mayor of West-Paris, the head of education hurriedly walked to his staff car, trying not to scan the uniforms of the SS guards too closely for Charlemagne badges. However, even as he drove away, he could not shake his worry; he passed by the carefully arranged rows of cheering German settlers celebrating the renaming, and saw the mainstay of the crowd. Herded out on the streets by the SS to ensure that in official photos it looked like the cheering crowds numbered in the thousands, the local Parisians had the usual look of disappointment and worry. However, unlike in Ost-Paris, in these crowds Cäsar could still spot the odd face twisted by rage and hatred, looking at his car with balled fists."

BRG_education.3.t:0 "Grammar Nazism"
BRG_education.3.d:0 "The German lesson was an unusually dull one for Peter, or Pierre as his parents called him at home. The complexity of the German cases and the intricacies of wrapping his tongue around the harsh consonants of The True Language was making Peter's head hurt, but the 11-year-old knew better than to doze off from his lessons. The usual SS Schulungsoffizier, a jovial, fat man who lived over the butcher in town, had the last few weeks been replaced with a young, fish-looking fellow with a wispy blonde mustache and the eyes of a hungry wolf. The boy's eyes dwelt on the man, just a moment, trying to determine what exactly about the wide mouth and flat nose made the young man so resemble a fish. Had it been the old Schulungsoffizier, he might have allowed himself a slight chuckle, but this new one did not fall asleep or read a book like his predecessor. Peter had lived long enough to know the men in the black clothes and leather boots were at their most dangerous when alert and attentive like this one. The man suddenly yelled out in German, and Peter nearly jumped out of his chair, but the German's anger, sudden and then gone like a sugar ration on a Sunday, was directed at his teacher. The officer seized the big ruler by the blackboard and held up the whimpering teacher's cheek with it, and began softly yet angrily speaking in a dialect of German Peter struggled to follow.\n\n"Name? Dein Name, Frankerscheiss!" \n\n"Guill- Wilhelm, Herr Schulungsoffizier! Wilhelm Oberstedt, aus Verd- uh, Siegerstadt!" \n\nThe conversation carried on for several tense moments, but as far as Peter understood, the issue revolved around whether the grammar the teacher was teaching was still right. When the officer seemed pleased, he removed the ruler from the teacher's cheek and turned to the 60 children in front of him. \n\n"Verstehst du mich, Kinder? Hochdeutsch ist für Hochvolk! Nicht für Sie! Der Staat urteilt, dass Sie diese Art von Grammatik nicht brauchen!" \n\nPeter didn't know what he said, but every child in Burgundy knew the correct response to his expectant tone."

BRG_education.4.d:0 "On paper the Wurstfest was a good idea. Many Frenchmen in the newly occupied regions stuck to their traditional form of cooking despite their limited access to ingredients from the rations. Too many times had the garrison soldiers of the newly rechristen Sankt Franz walked through the small town smelling the distinctly un-German smells of brioche or baguette. So, why not introduce them to the world-famous German kitchen, Standartenführer Karl Warheim had figured, German food was after all universally recognized as the best in the world? Karl was not entirely sure how his plan had ended him here, in a labor camp alongside thousands of untermensch who would probably have killed him in his sleep, if he had not successfully passed for Dutch due to his Wilhelmshaven accent. He stared into his bowl of gruel and tried to pinpoint the time where things had gone wrong. \n\nWhen his initial efforts had failed due to being unable to find the required amount of meat, Karl had written to Paris, to the head of the Schulungsamt himself to ask if he could get support for his cultural festival. Was that where he had gone wrong? It couldn't be; he had gotten approval for requesting the meat from the WVHA regional office. Was it how he had chosen not to report the sudden disappearance of local livestock before the festival? No, everybody knew that surprise confiscations was how meat was usually obtained following the cessation of food shipments from the Reich. That left the only other mistake he could think of; failing to keep the Wurstfest a local secret. On the day of the festival, endless lines of people showed up to beg the confused youths Karl had put behind the counters, for meat, for beer, even for sauerkraut. Karl couldn't say when the fight had first started, the line was so long it almost reached the next village over. Damned untermensch, he should never have trusted them to appreciate German food! When the OrStaPo vans showed up half an hour later and unleashed their cargo, it was with their usual rapid efficiency. Karl had been arrested the next morning while trying to organize some locals to help the garrison hose off the streets. Damned untermensch! \n\nThe sound of a baton on a bell signalled to Karl that dinner was over. He quickly shoveled the last spoonfuls of gruel into his mouth before getting back into line."

BRG_education.10.d:0 "If we are going to cleanse the French of the Latin stain of Old Gallia, we must help them see the true, proud past of the Franks, the old Germanic conquerors who would eventually degenerate into the current Frenchmen. It's long past due to bury historical relics like Posthumus and Syagrius and focus on teaching the untermensch of the conquering glory of Chlodwig and Karl Martell. However, opinions are divided on how to present the totality of French history. \n\nThe most recent centuries will of course only be quickly skipped through, since France was a slave of the Great Enemy in that time. While the mainstream view of the Office of Education is that we should disregard the times before Karl der Grosse and showcase French history as a matter of slow decline of order and greatness because of the monarchs gradually intermarrying with the Latins and mongrelizing their blood until they became weak enough to be toppled by the Judeo-Jacobins in 1789. \n\nThe Office of the Ahnenerbe disagrees. Over the course of their research into the lost history of the Aryans, they believe to have discovered documents purporting the Jews engineered the splitting of the realm of Karl der Grosse, bringing low the ancestors of the First Reich. This would certainly explain why the French failed to purge their Jews during the Crusades like their German counterparts. The Ahnenerbe thus suggests that French history after the West Frankish lords turned their back on the German language and culture in the 9th century should be quickly skipped through as an age of Darkness prior to the light brought to the land by their long lost German cousins in the forties. To make up for the loss in approved curriculum, they instead suggest classes on the true Old Gaul of the Celts, mighty warriors believed to be of partial Aryan heritage, before the Romans polluted their blood. \n\nWhat shall be our decision on the matter of the curriculum?"

In return for taking these books off the list, they offer their skills in digging through archives and libraries to help us locate as many books on the French language, poetry, linguistics and literary classics as possible. Burning all those would send a powerful message about the strength of conviction of the Kulturverbesserungsprojekt and the death of the effete French culture of old in favor of the new Burgundian identity, but...

We have no excuse for reeducating them, even if the SD and RHSA Office VII are convinced of ballooning disloyalty in the Walloons legions. Two strategies have been formulated for dealing with the disloyal elements. The OKW wants to send them on a permanent anti-partisan campaign across the Ordensstaat with minimal resupply and reinforcement. That should thin out their ranks pretty heavily in just a few months, leaving the survivors unable to organize any sort of effective resistance to our control and giving us an excuse to promote freshly educated and loyal officers. The RHSA however views this as too slow and a waste of manpower and potential to root out disloyal networks. They instead propose fabricating charges against a selection of senior personnel, and after their mock trials and definitely-not-mock executions we will have all the excuse we need to conduct a full review of the Walloons legions, arresting those who need arresting and sending the rest to reeducation and ideological compliance checks.

BRG_education.13.t:0 "A Pleasant Chat About History"
BRG_education.13.d:0 ""So you are saying the Jews set out to sabotage Ludwig der Fromme because they feared the strong Christian commitment of him and his father Karl der Grosse?" \n\nThe historians of the Ahnenerbe Middle and Newer History Institute voiced their affirmation almost in unison, enraptured in a strange mix of awe, terror, pride and pleasant surprise at the good mood and friendly demeanour the Reichsführer SS, who was sat snugly in a reclining chair in their Paris office, sipping a cup of glauwein. They had heard Dr. Cäsar, their de jure superior with his position as head of the Office of Education and Culture, would be dropping by to discuss their proposed changes to the KVP's history curriculum reforms, but they had not expected Heinrich Himmler, of all people, to tag along from the emergency meeting which had brought him to Paris. The good doctor himself sat silent and seemingly terrified in the corner, but the Reichsführer did not notice, smiling from ear to ear and flipping through one of the Ahnenerbe's textbooks. \n\n"Remarkable, remarkable! It is so good to put aside the time to speak with men of true skill and vision in the intellectual sphere once more. It has been too many years. I have spent many a moment between meetings recently reflecting on the shared Aryan history we had with the Franks before they became so... French. Brilliant work, this book, even gives some glimpses of the era after the French destroyed France. But... Did I just see passage stating Nostradamus might have been an agent of the Jews?" \n\nThe room fell deadly silent, everyone present replaying the last sentence in their minds and trying to gauge whether the Reichsführer approved or not. Eventually Dr. Cäsar cleared his throat. \n\n"That is the reigning scientific opinion, mein Führer..." He noticed the smile fading from Himmler's eyes. "...but you are in luck, this particular question has been of historical interest for some time, and so Dr. Herbert have recently commissioned a study on just this subject, haven't you Carl?" \n\nDr. Carl Herbert's eyes shot daggers at Cäsar, but he smiled at the Reichsführer and nodded. \n\n"Indeed I have, I very recently approved a student's postgraduate thesis proposal on the question of Nostradamus." \n\nHimmler leaned back in his chair smiling again, and the room drew a quiet sigh of relief."

BRG_education.14.t:0 "Quite Frankly, A Success"
BRG_education.14.d:0 "Dr. Cäsar smiled as the group of French children finished singing the Wacht am Rhein in perfect Hochdeutsch outside the town hall of Pictstadt, former Poitiers. Having shown remarkable intellectual propensity hinting at significant Aryan heritage, he had personally signed off on the order to allow this class of especially gifted youngsters to be taught the language of the Master Race, rather than mere Simpeldeutsch. He was proud of what he had achieved in recent months, he felt like he truly had sown the seeds of a genuine Burgundian culture, and the feeling made his aging joints feel softer again. Behind his eyes he was sure the bystanders could see the flame of passion for the cause of the SS that had once carried him to the top of the hierarchy of the SS in those distant thirties. These children had never seen those years. None of them had any memory of a time without the Scuthzstaffel to protect and guide their inferiors and help all humanity achieve new heights. They had little concept of "France" or "Resistance," much less the games of power played at the lofty heights of power in Paris, through which Cäsar was forced to wade on the daily. In a way he envied their innocence and their total acceptance of the world as is. These children were the Franks of old reborn, a mix of Aryans Germans and Little Aryan Celts who had once made the Roman might tremble before them. Even if they were not as racially pure as the true upper classes, these children were not French."
BRG_education.14.a:0 "They are Burgundians."

BRG_education.15.t:0 "What's In A Name?"
BRG_education.15.d:0 "The citizens of Orleáns clapped intensely as the new sign reading "Rathaus der Aurelstadt" was unveiled at their city hall. Much to the perturbation and disgust of the older generations, some of the young teens and children seemed to be genuinely excited. After an evening of feasting on beer, wurst and sauerkraut on the Himmlerplatz, the collaborators of Aurelstadt went home, full of food for the first time in months and with a slight buzz of alcohol for the first time in even longer. All across France similar stories played out again and again. Manceller, Merowechskrone, Stefanstadt... Cities, streets, places were all transforming into indelible reminders of the regime to thunderous applause. Yet nobody shouted or rioted, very few dared even protest silently by averting their eyes. Watchful men in black patrolled along the sidewalks, atop the buildings surrounding the plazas, along the paths in the parks. There would be no chaos, no insurrection. As the sun set on the dark heart of the Black Spot of Europe, there were few reminders this place was once known as the City of Lights, an oppressive darkness ensured by the rationing of electricity and the poor quality of bulbs in the streetlights. Yet the buildings of government still blazed with light, the last vestiges of the city of old yet at the same time the heralds of its funeral. For the celebrations in the government buildings that night were those of the men that had killed Old France. Only a handful of locations were the officials of government not enraptured by their rations of beer and the blazing of film projectors showing the final wave of German renamings. One such place was a minimally decorated conference room, in which a committee quietly voted to scrap a renaming proposal for Paris for fear of that being one humiliation too much for even the untermensch to bear. And in a different building, in an even more Spartan office, a pale, aging man finished his paperwork, eager to leave Paris and return to his home in Elsass. He looked at his wall clock, then at the new map he had been delivered that day. The Reichsführer read the names and smiled."

BRG_education.16.d:0 ""Ah, so this is the Alley of the Artists! What are you scum up to in there? Let me in, official inspection for degeneracy and vagrantry!" \n\nThe uniform of the SS man was so convincing that Pierre Desmoulins almost did not notice the officer's accent, or rather a lack of one. Still, it had to be the one he had been waiting for, no SS officers ever visited the Alley of the Artists, especially not on a bike and carrying a rifle bag. He decided to play along for the sake of potential witnesses, waving the man along with one of his raggedy fingerless gloves as a pointer. \n\n"We don't know anything about anything, Herr Offizier, this is just an alley of poor artists out of a job and a house. We stay here far out of Paris where we won't be no trouble and we don't bother none." \n\n"That is not what I hear. Rumor has it you lot are homeless because you are former staff of the Louvre who had your homes burned down for hiding art you had taken from there." \n\n"One hears a lot of things. Sure, some of us might have had our houses burned, our art taken and our pets or even family members killed, but ultimately that is just too common a story here on this Tarpeian Rock of Paris." \n\nThe officer smiled a devilish grin, recognizing the password, and his whole demeanour changed in an instant. \n\n"Ah, thank you for the tour,, shall we begin? My name is Matteotti, my client may have mentioned me in his letter" \n\nPierre lept into a trash can and waved him off, "just get her out." At his signal, the angry homeless around seemed to quiet.\n\n"Do you have her?" \n\nPierre found what he looking for in a tightly knit plastic bag near the  bottom of the bin. He pulled the bag off to reveal the cardboard tube within. \n\n"She is not safe here; they are burning art, Matteotti. She should return home. Take care when you get into the Alps, the canvas will not survive contact with water. Tell your employer he can do with her what he wants, as long as she is not displayed in public." \n\nMatteotti nodded silently, put the tube in his rifle bag, and got back on his bike, trusting in his falsified papers to carry him back to the Swiss and then Italian border."

BRG_education.17.d:0 "It felt strange for Peter to speak French again, especially so loud. For many months he had only spoken it at home with his parents in hushed tones. But now he was not only allowed to speak it, but told to speak loudly and clearly so the Schulungsoffizier could hear him. He kept telling his friends about how he had been named after his mother's father, a conservator at the Louvre, but allowed himself a quick peek at the officer. The man, a Walloon by his accent, looked bored and borderline suffering despite seemingly leaning relaxed up against the wall of the school. The man who looked like a fish had assigned him to keep an eye and an ear out for the children in the new Redefreiheitszone established in a corner of the schoolyard. Peter was happy the Reichsführer allowed the children to speak French, even if under supervision. Maybe the SS was not as bad as his parents said. His thoughts were interrupted by the officer, who was looking at his watch.\n\n"Raus, kinder! Votre temps est écoulé!"\n\nAs Peter and his friends left the Zone to let the next group speak, the boy couldn't help but imagine himself in a black uniform and think about how strong and brave he would feel."

BRG_education.18.d:0 "The darkness of the rainy night was laying tight around Hohkönigsburg in Elsass, far away from the light pollution of the great cities of the Reich. In one of the few lit rooms of the castle, its owner was working, paying little heed to the rain beating against the thick glass of the windows. Heinrich Himmler was working in candlelight; he could not stand the bright electrical light of the bulb in the ceiling this late in the night. His glasses had sunk to the tip of his nose, but he kept scrawling intensely in his notebook. Occasionally, he picked up a paper from his simple wooden desk and looked at it in dismay. Those fools who called themselves men of the Schutzstaffel had made a mess of his plans for converting the French, indulging in all sorts of luxuries and weakness to try to convince the French that being German was swell. Sauerkraut? Wurst? Beer? This was not the spirit the SS wanted to build for the Ordensstaat! Aside from coddling the untermensch, the Aryans would have to learn to live without such luxuries during what is to come. Flipping back through the papers to find the directive to ban the production, sale and distribution of wines, he noted on it to also cut the beer ration in half for members of the SS and limit sales to untermensch to written permission only. His eyes caught the telephone on his desk. Dr. Cäsar had been a useful tool in the execution of the reeducation of the French, even if the results had been less than optimal so far. Maybe he could phone him and tell him to gather up the inner circle in Paris, then come to Hohkönigsburg to discuss how they could salvage this mess of a project? He rolled the pen between his fingers for a few seconds before making his decision."

BRG_education.19.t:0 "The Empty Heart"
BRG_education.19.d:0 "In the heart of France there was Paris. In the heart of Paris there was the Louvre. And in the heart of the Louvre the halls blazed with color and light, the collective expression of the emotions and expression of humankind caught within its thousands of paintings and statuary. \n\nHauptsturmführer Gerhard Wiesler sneered at the photo in dismay, throwing the memory of the degenerate art of old to the ground and stomping the frame and glass to bits under his steel tipped jackboot. He cast a last glance around the room, in case he had missed any rolled up paintings. Nothing. There was very little left of what must once have been a comfortable office. The paint was cracked and chipping, the bookshelves destroyed and the floor covered in crumpled papers. The wooden desk was long gone, though an oxidized bronze sign reading "Desmoulins" could still be spotted among the papers that had been ruined by rain through the broken window. \n\nWiesler exited the office, joining back up with his two colleagues, who were observing half a dozen slaves removing the carpets and scraping off the chipping paint of the walls of the exhibition halls, lit only by gas lamps. \n\n"Nicht." \n\n"A shame, I heard Grüber made a small fortune selling art he'd saved from the bonfires when he defected to the Swiss." \n\n"I hope you two aren't planning on jumping ship, I would have hated to have to shoot you." \n\nThe three men burst into laughter, before the ripping sound of carpets being cut drew Wiesler's attention. "It is so empty here now. I am glad to be rid of this Schlavekultur, but one have to wonder what they're going to use the space for. Why not just demolish it?" \n\n"I hear the RHSA want to rename it the Löwenhall and use it for office space." \n\n"I heard the Ahnenerbe wants to open a Museum of Aryan History here." \n\nThe men mused on for a while, their voice increasingly becoming a dull monotone as the hours dragged deeper into the night. By dawn they were done with their shift, and as they left, the Louvre fell silent, waiting for the next team of workers to continue pulling it apart. But for now it remained, the silent, dark and dead heart of a nation. "

BRG_education.20.d:0 "While the main part of the educational reform has focused on the social sciences, for obvious reasons, we cannot get so caught up in the humaniora that we lose sight of the regular sciences. We have a space in our mandated learning plan for one more subject, we only have to decide which subject from the Aryan learning plan should also be present in the Untermensch learning plan. The Office of Education and Culture wants us to teach applied chemistry to the children, to address the shortage of skilled labor our chemical industry is facing. The Ahnenerbe suggests teaching them genealogy; by allowing the children to explore their own ancestry will help them immensely in tracking Aryan genetic dispersal in the French population and help locate potential future recruits of the SS. The Schulungsoffiziere will of course inspect the childrens' handins very carefully for signs of racial pollution, especially names associated with the Great Enemy. Finally, Dr. Cäsar recently received an unsigned letter marked with a Valknut, slid under his door by someone unknown. It suggests teaching the children Ariosophy will make them more compliant by showing them the occult and divine powers of the Master Race. Which shall we promote."

BRG_education.21.d:0 "The KVP has successfully lobbied the government to ban the performance, production, sale and sharing of French music, but we have hit a snag in what music to define as "French." Music with French vocals should obviously be banned, but what about orchestral pieces? As most of the famous French orchestral musicians come from the Northeast and Ile-De-France, the Ahnenerbe believes many of the composers may have had significant Aryan blood. There is also the issue of the Reichsführer, he is fond of classical music, especially when in... volatile moods. Banning a piece he enjoys might annoy him significantly. Is taking a hardline stance against French culture worth risking worsening his mood?"

While the brave soldiers of the Waffen-SS fought the Slavic hordes alongside the Wehrmacht, the rest of the SS were fighting their own, secret war with the Great Enemy, tracking them down, rounding them up and sending them to...? Klara?" \n\n"The KZ-Lager, where evil people go!" \n\n"Very good Klara. Ever since the start of the New Order in 1933, the SS have been rounding up evildoers and sending them to the KZ-Lager. That is why you can walk the streets safe now and not worry about criminals stealing from you, bolsheviks burning your home or Jews taking you children away, like it used to be in the old days. Now, Peter, I know you have done your homework on the Outside World. In the last few years, most of the SS have come here to the Ordensstaat because three great servants of the Great Enemy have retaken control over the world after the death of the Old Führer. Which one of them is considered so dangerous to the Aryans and the French that he is often called the Little Enemy?""

After we took control of France, the situation has gotten even worse, as the French really love their smokes. No matter how we ban it or how many cigarette smugglers we shoot, packs keep showing up on the black market. It also doesn't help that those trusted SS personnel who are allowed to visit the nations of the Pakt and the Reich proper are almost without fault sneaking packs with them back, hidden in boots and uniforms, sometimes even in their luggage if they know the border guards doing the searches. Division Charlemagne's French members share the nicotine addiction of their countrymen and are paying considerable sums to both black market dealers and their fellow SS for the chance to acquire a pack. Should we try to step up our crackdown on black market cigarettes, or is it a waste of resources to try to save the lives of mostly non-Germans who are too stupid to make healthy life choices?"

They knew to keep their head down after our takeover of the area, and have bought their relative comfort with generous donations to the SS in terms of both money and sons for the Walloon Legion. However, now with the uncertain loyalty of French speakers, the Inner Circle are in complete agreement that any potential rally points for independence movements must be eliminated or minimized, and that includes the old Belgian nobility. The hardliners in the cabinet argue all remaining titles of nobility should be abolished throughout the Ordensstaat to show the untermensch that they are all equally unworthy and that the only true nobility is the Black Knights of the SS. The moderates instead argue that we should mimic the old Teutonic Ordensstaat and replace all noble titles with Germanic ones granted by and revocable by the Reichsführer. This means we can reward collaborators and punish the less enthusiastic using little more than empty words. What is our final decision?"

 BRG.2000.t:0 "Twilight of the Diplomat"
 BRG.2000.desc:0 "The Reichsführer-SS sat at his desk, shuffling through his papers. Wall upon wall of text, yet they all seemed the same. As his eyes misted over, he barely heard the dull thud of his door swinging open, slamming on the hinges. Von Ribbentrop. An old ally, or as close to an ally as could be trusted. A curt nod nonetheless, precise and cold. He had earned nothing more. "Ribbentrop. I trust that you are well?" \n\nThe man was...different, even under the Reichsführer's cursory gaze. He marched with none of his trademark confidence or zest - and slammed down a manila folder on the Reichsführer's desk. "A letter, Herr Reichsführer." Was it just him, or was there fear in Ribbentrop's eyes? The Reichsführer-SS's brows arched. He opened the folder, pulling out a small piece of paper, and squinted. The words quickly became obvious through the Fraktur: A CONDEMNATION. Its signatories were more disturbing still: Admiral Krancke. Admiral Voss.\n\nand Joachim von Ribbentrop. \n\n"What is this?" The Reichsführer-SS' hand trembled ever so slightly. A betrayal. Here. Now. Who else? Could no one be trusted?\n\n"Herr Reichsführer, in my capacity I must object to our intervention in the French State. I do not intend to condemn or suborn you - do not misconstrue me - " He bent over and rasped, the effort visibly pained. "The Fatherland bleeds, and night falls ever darker there. Would it not be wise to spare Aryan blood, Aryan treasure, and preserve lives in the territory we control? Herr Reichsführer, you of all people know I have been a loyal servant. It is my sincere belief that our work here will suffer from this military adventure. If only for my sake, please consider heeding my advice."\n\n"You are dismissed, Herr von Ribbentrop." As he watched Ribbentrop salute and walk out of the room, he picked up the phone and dialed the Sicherheitsdienst. Promotion season was coming early for someone today. "

Not even the Royal Navy, the pinnacle of surface fleets, could withstand the might of the Kriegsmarine and her legions of U-boats. The United States and Imperial Japanese Navies have both implemented similar strategies, having dozens of submarines haul their atomic arsenals beneath the seven seas. And if we are to succeed as a nuclear power, we must learn from the successes of those around us.\n\nThe admirals of the Schutzmarine, in collaboration with the SS-VWA, have developed a program named "Jörmungand," after the World-Serpent of Norse myth who lies beneath the waves in anticipation of Ragnarök. Dozens of submarines shall silently patrol the depths of the ocean, with a particular emphasis on the North Sea and north Atlantic. Construction is already progressing on new bases and pens along the coast of the English Channel, in isolated locations far away from prying eyes. All we need are submarines with which to fill them."

We can rely no more on stripped-down designs reluctantly sourced to us by the Luftwaffe, so we must innovate on our own. And by innovate, we mean steal the necessary technology from those who would have squandered it anyway.\n\nHowever, this military expenditure would be pointless without the proper facilities to accommodate it. The "Donar" nuclear air defense program calls for the construction of new airbases with runways and hangars large enough to handle nuclear bombers, and construction is surprisingly ahead of schedule. The Bilskirnir base is nearly complete, and the Thrudheim and Thrudvang bases are soon to follow. When completed, the airbases will allow our bombers to reach nearly all of Europe-or further, if they have no plans of returning."

Thankfully, none of the missile silos had progressed far enough in their construction where the design was irreversibly set, so the changes were easily incorporated.\n\nThe scientists also got the opportunity to pore over the data from our nuclear experiment, where several concrete test structures had been placed in varying locations around the site before detonation. By cross-referencing this with other non-nuclear concrete stress tests, as well as pilfered German test results, they have determined that nothing short of a direct strike by a ballistic missile on the silo doors will be able to compromise their functionality. Furthermore, if American and Japanese missiles are anything like the German ones, the precision to directly strike something less than five meters wide is non-existent. When these missiles are ready, they will be nearly impossible to dislodge."

The results were nothing short of impressive: the average time from orders received to launch sequence completed decreased by more than half, with the quickest facility crew being able to theoretically prep and launch their arsenal in under ten minutes. Their bases have also been fully stocked, secure phone and telegraph lines have connected the bases with both Ost-Paris and their neighbors, and their commanders have been briefed on procedures if contact with the SS-VWA main headquarters is lost.

If they read off a certain sequence of codewords-or if transmission stops entirely-then the relay bunkers are to contact an SS-WVA Obergruppenführer in a secure secondary location, who will receive all authority on whether to launch a secondary strike. If the secondary location is unreachable, then the relay bunkers are to immediately broadcast firing orders to the Niflheim, Jörmungard, and Donar programs, thereby beginning Operation Ragnarök and unleashing the entirety of the Burgundian arsenal at the capitals of the other world powers.\n\nAs the transmitters in the Gjallarhorn bunker begin sending out their broadcast, everyone is smiling, most of all the Reichsführer-SS.

Significant damage was sustained to several of the laboratories in the particle physics wings and their archives, with hundreds of research papers and schematics lost in the blaze. Some have come to suspect espionage or sabotage, due to the destruction of blueprints for pressurised-water reactors that were commissioned by the English government. Preliminary evidence has pointed in the direction of the Japanese Kempeitai, suggesting that this was due to the machinations of the Imperial Navy. But unless further evidence is brought to light, it seems that this case shall never be solved by the police.\n\nAlthough propagandists in the Reich and England's national socialist minority insist that England's history of nuclear innovation is due to their Anglo-Saxon ancestry, most of it was because of the head start afforded by the United Kingdom's "Tube Alloys" nuclear project, much of which fell into collaborator hands after the War-not to mention how they have a limited degree of informal collaboration with other scientists in the former Commonwealth. But regardless of whether it is by blood or by brains, English scientists developed plans for reactors that the Schutzmarine desperately wanted for their top-of-the-line U-boats.

Its second highest priority would also be to shelter the nuclear U-boat fleet from attack long enough for them to launch their payloads in the event of a global thermonculear war, even if it leads to the surface fleet's total destruction. For these key purposes, the Schutzmarine admiralty have commissioned a series of destroyers, frigates, and depot ships focused on speed and inflicting as much damage on the enemy as possible.

Tests show that they are able to stay in the air at cruising speed just as long as our bombers, and then some. Even more impressively, our engineers have designed them in a way that does not significantly sacrifice their armaments, meaning that they will be able to actually defend the bombers they are meant to escort.\n\nThe Reichsführer-SS was elated by the news and ordered that production begin immediately, insisting that the protection of the bombers was necessary to fully secure the completeness of the Ordensstaat's nuclear program on land, sea, and air."

Much of it was able to be found within the Ordensstaat, while some of it did require reverse-engineering based on photographs. When these machines were shown to an agent who was assigned to the Boeing op, he-thankfully-confirmed that our reconstruction functioned exactly as the one he observed.\n\nThere was one part that proved to be more difficult to replicate than the others. Agents had mentioned in reports a mechanism called the "SWESS," a fail-safe which would trigger a bomber's payload if it were to fall below a particular altitude. However, they were unable to acquire photographs of schematics of it.

Already, our nuclear engineers are poring over the data and developing new methods of improvement.

We are Aryan, we are Germanic, and we are the genetic-deservant of this world's power, we shall not allow any subhuman to declare themselves masters above us, no matter how much ash, blood, and bodies strewn across the streets of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund."

Rather, those grey skies, with constant downpours of rain and chilling winds carry with it ash, the ash which flutters from the burning corpses of the Aryan's enemies and the trucks and guns we've burned away. \n\nMere hours ago, "Einsatz Ehrentod" began, from Ost-Parisian halls and out onto the battlefields where Aryan soldiers, bred and forged into the machines of war they were destined to be. Out there, the gunfire and pounding of shells splattered the land with rubble and gore, as more and more men fell to their deaths in this dreaded insurrection. However, out there, on the fields and cities where the First and Second World Wars were fought, our enemies beheld a sight they deemed magnificent in their short burst of hope: that is, the Aryan man, retreating from the battle as men put away their guns and seemingly left the trenches that claimed so many men's lives. In those mere moments, flashes of cheering began, as Frenchman and Belgian embraced their comrades as it appeared that the battle had been one for their corrupt democracies, arrogant claims of independence, and disgusting love of an otherwise unholy Church. \n\nHowever, as the decadent are dashed against the might of the just, so too are their hopes dashed against the stone. Fires and plumes of smoke reaching the heavens of Valhalla, visible even from Ost-Paris showcase the destruction sown by the Aryan man. Our unyielding wrath as they find weakness and starvation, with no sign of refuel or resupply as far as the eye may see, upon this scorched earth."

 BRG_collapse.3.t:0 "O'er the Night of the Black Sun"
 BRG_collapse.3.d:0 "The first day was filled with joy and revelry. The entirety of that night had consisted of short, deadly attacks on unsuspecting Schutzstaffel regiments and their officers, breaking up their forces until, eventually, the people united into one grand revolution. Together, we pushed back the Aryans out of the territory they claimed so long ago, and created a state for ourselves. Even the Colonel, as hardlining and traditionalist as a European officer could get, stopped to enjoy the revelry and a glass of wine amidst our military successes against the Aryans who butchered us for so long. \n\nBut, as the war progressed, so too did the joys of that first morning wane. The more firefights, the more loss of men, and while we continued to push back the Aryans, we could not help but feel the weariness grew upon the scorched, broken earth they left behind in their retreat's wake. Nevertheless, we journeyed on, past the wreckage and ruin of our great countryside, now dominated by the presence of Aryan brutalism and tyranny, where every useful station of supply or potential radio area had been smashed and burned. Food and water sources grew more scarce as the days went on, and the lack of supplies and support thanks to the destruction left behind of our enemy's retreat led to infighting in our ranks. The exhaustion grew with every passing of another potential resource that had been left in smoldering ruin. \n\nIn retrospect, that all seemed so simple compared to now. The destruction grew so bad that we came face to face with just continuous blackened ruins, looking more like the battlefield of Verdun or the Somme than typical life. There we made our entrenchment. And there was when the Black Sun rose. As machine guns rained hell on us, before wave upon wave of beast ran at us. Former comrades, beaten and starved into submission, and sent to our ranks with the simplest of weaponry, from outdated rifles to just a set of explosives to the very trench knives used to butcher their countrymen. Now, the Colonel lays next to me in this trench, his skull having been bashed in by the enemy, as his blood drips into my still mouth. Now, all I can do is play dead here, as the enemy scavenges us like beasts, while I merely hope they do not hear my heart beat."
 BRG_collapse.3.a:0 "We shall be their end."
 BRG_collapse.4.t:0 "Things are...different, now"
 BRG_collapse.4.d:0 "Things weren't always this way. Being anointed as the commander of some of the largest groups of Waffen-Schutzstaffel divisions is a true honor within the Ordenstaat. However, where glorious success means honor given towards the state and the Reichsführer-SS, dire times lends itself to times away from such success. Rather, it delivers disappointment, and disappointment in this scenario could result in an untimely demise, in a time where every demise would cost the Ordenstaat dearly, given the state of the battlefields out there. However, Peiper would not die easily. No, he would not die at all, provided his plan worked in the face of the Reichsführer-SS himself. \n\nWhat once shined with the brightest of pride and satisfaction in the news of new successes in the name of National Socialism now darkened the room, as the thunderstorm outside already dimmed the area, alongside the ash flying throughout the skies. A conversation followed the entrance into the Reichsführer-SS's office. A conversation which skipped across a dozen or so topics, from our successes, to Aryan traditionalism, to leadership changes, to military doctrine, to our failures. The true meaning of the meeting would eventually crop up, as the Brigadeführer pressed a new idea forward in retrospect to the price of our victory. A victory born through our industry, our propulsion technology, and our warheads, rather than a victory born through the blood of the Aryan soldier. \n\nAnd this was the conversation that led the Brigadeführer to the living situation he found himself in, as the truck continued to rumble, surrounded by four men with assault rifles that were as willing to blow his brains out as any potential threats to the man's life. This would be what Peiper would find for his future, not one in which he could enjoy the pleasures of the battlefield and the taste of the subhuman's blood adorning his lips; rather, it was one of travelling between all of the nuclear weapons facilities to prepare for the next step in this war."

However, history has seemingly flipped to the next page of the chronicle, as we true Aryans have truly been crowned with Masters of this World with the victory we have claimed today. \n\nAcross the Ordenstaat, enemies flee for their lives in hope that they may escape from the fate that had been consigned to them from the moment of their birth as a subhuman. However, what these misguided, misshapen fools trick themselves into believing is that they actually stand a chance against the might of Aryan forces. Where they fell in battle, they surely shall not find themselves successful in what has become their inevitable retreat. Be they one of the decadent Frenchmen, a barbaric Belgian or Flanderian, or one of the Judeo-Bolsheviks rallying behind the image of the Red Poppy, all have fallen against our true and glorious nature, a nature directly encoded into our genetics, as we have found victory once again in the face of the decadence of this world. \n\nAbove all, however, this day proclaims a great triumph for the Reichsführer-SS in the face of the corrupt opposition that so desperately died against our might. Now is not the time to halt, or falter from here, however: now is the time for planning. Now, we bask in the light of our conquest to bring glory to the vision of the Reichsführer-SS."

Rather than the potential for victory, the potential for annihilation rests upon all of our shoulders, and you and I are no different in this, Reichsführer-SS. The forces of the Charlemagne division have found the actions of the leadership to be irredeemable in their wanton destruction of everything we are, and every aspect of Frenchdom throughout the Ordenstaat. Even as we had continued to serve diligently, every aspect of our life was abused in favor of your Aryan fanaticism, even to the point of French extermination at our own hands. Now, however, things have turned. \n\nThis war has stretched for far too long, and we have found ourselves able to achieve success today, through the securing of nuclear weapons manufactured within the Ordenstaat. Whilst war typically regarded the successes of men on the battlefield, the twentieth century now sees conflict as bargaining chips and intimidation, as I'm sure you are more than reluctant to continue under the nose of nuclear missiles under our command. The Ordenstaat, your "exemplary" Aryan population, and yourself will not be able to stand and survive with the nuclear onslaught we promise if you do not comply with the immediate demand of armistice and an end to this slaughterous conflict. You have 10 hours to respond. \n\nChristian de la Mazière"

 BRG_collapse.12.d:0 "ADDRESSED TO SS-HAUPTAMT AND OFFICE OF REICHSFÜHRER-SS \n\nIn short: \n\nIn my personal belief, I believe there is far more to investigate and come to the conclusion over rather than allow further relations to promote more unnecessary death upon Flanders and the rest of the Ordenstaat. In recognizing a desire for loyalty and cooperation, I believe it is inherent within the wisdom of the Reichsführer-SS to work towards another solution, rather than allowing his business to be halted at the hands of rebellions and uprisings, of which I believe, if negotiated correctly, could come to a well enough peace between our sides which shall guarantee a new degree of collaboration between the regimes of the Ordenstaat and those among Langemarck. \n\nOf course, the nature of this document begets a certain explanation regarding the sudden reach for negotiations rather than giving the green flag towards further military operations against your own forces. In particular, the military acquisition of nuclear arms developed by the Ordenstaat following several victories against your forces has left the leadership divided between advocates for unrestricted nuclear warfare against the Ordenstaat, and those wishing for a more diplomatic solution. In regards to the latter, we shall use these as a bargaining chip in the potential support of both of our states, so that we may end this conflict for once and for all. Military leadership of the Langemarck organization is dutifully awaiting a response, and will take matters into our own hands if a response is not made."

But when radio static and panic is all you have to work with, how could you ever possibly be prepared in the face of death? \n\nIt all started this morning. The thunderstorm that has persisted over our camp and across the Ordenstaat over the past few weeks died down, thankfully. It took time, effort, and diligence to work your way into the Schutzstaffel leadership, especially as someone with a small familial upbringing, and especially when this certain someone has achieved leadership over KZ-Lager Aurelstadt. However, my leadership qualities were forged in my time, and the call to crisis happened to be one of these skills, which erupted exactly as the radio call came in about the threat of nuclear bombing of several military targets on behalf of the Northern rebellions. Camp leadership was in shock, and before I turned to regard the message as a potential false alarm, the radio piped in once more that nuclear targets were expanding as some cities were to be targeted, including valuable industrial areas. \n\nEveryone was stunned, no one could believe that they had gotten their hands on nuclear missiles in the war. But now was not the time for inaction. We ordered the evacuation of the entirety of KZ-Lager Aurelstadt, informing the slaves that they had to be moved in order to supply other areas during a routine inspection, whilst the high command all waited. Eventually, I directly ordered the rest of the high command out, to lead them away. It was then that I faced the reality of the situation. Was this my destiny, deemed unworthy to lead in the Ordenstaat amidst so many powerful Aryan men? I suppose the question could not be answered in time as the missile descended into the sky."

 BRG_collapse.14.t:0 "Sermons on a Steel Truck"
 BRG_collapse.14.d:0 "Turonen had become the pinnacle of Aryan brutalist desires under our leadership. There, degenerates and advocates of corruption learned to kneel, or else face the wrath of the Germanic warrior should they desire to further corrupt the earth with their insufferable pleas for mercy and compassion. My growth there was slow, but calculated and meticulous. All plans and actions taken with precise estimation with a healthy dollop of cunning backing it, allowing me to climb until I was one of the city's prime members of leadership. \n\nNow, we sit at the head of a convoy, in a cramped steel truck spitting out noxious fumes, running away from the city I held so tightly in my grasp. Now, all plans of mine have fallen to ruin at the hands of the damned barbarians to the Northeast, those who think themselves so proud, so cocksure as to rise against the Aryans who have claimed this land for National Socialism, for the greatness of all of greater men who ought to dominate on this Earth. Threats of nuclear warfare after the destruction of Aurelstadt at the hands of the mongrels who deem themselves worthy of a European throne when they sit upon a throne built from degeneracy and Judeo-Bolshevism. We shall rise once more, past all of their bombings, no matter how many cities it takes. \n\nIt was then that the sonic boom happened, when the bright flash and cloud of smoke shot into the sky, and all of Turonen was enveloped in a wall of nuclear hellfire. All of the men turned and scowled, harrowed by the fear dealt from the atomic blast. One officer broke down in tears, clutching a secret Christian rosary he kept in his trench coat pocket while reciting a Judeo-Bolshevik Hail Mary. With the pulling of the trigger upon my Walther P38, and a crack through the air, all the men paid attention to the former officer, with a whole through his cheek and blood running out his mouth and down his cheek. The weak shall pay for their crimes which allowed for this downfall."

All of those who had fought so desperately to overthrow our justified claims over the beasts who ruled this land prior, all of them have mustered together to try to stab the great Aryan example to the world in the back, sending so much of our efforts tumbling down. Nevertheless, the Reichsführer-SS is a wise, strong leader, and under his leadership shall we deliver the Ordenstaat from this signature hell that our enemies have forged. Now, however, under the command of both the name of the Reichsführer-SS and the name of Peiper, the Ordenstaat shall reclaim a glorious shine on this world. \n\nDeep within the military complexes of the Ordenstaat, however, was where this process began. Day after day, it was not the assembly of troops, or the training of potential new recruits for high command, or the preparation and deployment of new equipment for the Waffen-Schutzstaffel which would earn us our victory. However, it was the newest Operation issued from the Reichsführer-SS. The immediate direction of nuclear production and resources towards one military operation, an action which shall find French knees quaking, Belgian and Flanderian hugging one another, begging for mercy and forgiveness, and the Catholics praying towards their false gods as they all bear witness to the might. \n\nYes, it may have been the operation of our armored and motorized divisions which helped us to win this war. Yes, the influence of our advanced firearms, exceptional artillery, masterful aerial combatants, and the overall might of the Aryan strongarm as it dealt blow after blow to our enemies, ensuring their spilt blood to be the key to the Second World War. But now, it shall be the might of the Aryan mind which wins this war, as Brigadeführer Peiper bore witness to row upon row of nuclear missile, preparing for operation to use against the decadence threatening the Ordenstaat."
 BRG_collapse.15.a:0 "Valhalla awaits."
 BRG_collapse.16.t:0 "The Strike Back"
 BRG_collapse.16.d:0 "From the perspective of the upper echelons of the SS-Burgund, the history and racial characteristics of the French people left a lot to be desired. After all, these were untermensch thrice beaten by the Aryan, destined to spend some small time serving their superiors material desires, and then soon doomed after the fires consumed the planet. Perhaps this was why, despite the fanaticism and loyalty that SS-Charlemagne had demonstrated during the Second Weltkrieg, they were shunted aside during the implementation of the Ordenstaat and the Burgundian way. \n\nAnd so it has led to this, as the allies of the SS-Bergund fought against it, and threatened to use the very weapons they had long cultivated as a tool for the great global transformation against them. It was this same arrogance that led the Reichsführer-SS and his closest advisors to assume that surely the French legions would not dare to use weapons of mass destruction against their German foes. After all, they were at their core cowardly and degenerate, and thus incapable of matching the will of the Aryan.\n\nBut the French SS legions had been for so long subsumed in the madness and hunger of the Ordenstaat that they had taken its ideology and made it their own. So when Himmler ordered his soldiers to continue the advance, the missles flew. The SS attack positions were obliterated, soon followed by their command infrastructure in the rear, and then the high value targets in the Burgundian interior.\n\nDid they think that there would be no retaliation? That the Burgundians would be too astonished by the nerve of their former puppets to respond quickly enough? Or that they might be lucky enough to kill the Reichsfurher-SS in their attack, and his dark state would die with him? No one can say. Perhaps they predicted a response, but chose to go into the darkness on their own terms with as many of the enemy following them as possible. \n\nEither way, the missles flew and the Shadow State, so long submerged in darkness and secrecy, burnt bright for moments before returning to embers. In time, a few survivors would crawl out into the radioactive wasteland, although few would last long."

Compared to the hallowed nations of great renown -- the Aryans, the Yamato people, the Americans -- very little. There were no stories of their feared strength, great constructions, or terrible victories. By the standards of the Reichsführer-SS and his minions, they were a people of small account -- just worthy of having their own small legion within the military of the Ordenstaat, to be quickly wiped out when the true designs of National Socialism were implemented. \n\nBut the arrogance of the Aryan led them to fatally underestimate their opponent. Although not nearly as numerous or well-equipped as their opponents, the SS-Langemarck matched them in the ability to unleash nuclear destruction. \n\n"Surely", thought the Riechsfurher and his close compatriots when the missive from their enemy was delivered, "such a small and worthless nation would not dare to challenge the Aryan in a truly total war". They were wrong. \n\nThe Walloonians turned out to be as good as their word, and unleashed a devastating salvo of atomic missiles upon the Burgundians, who promptly retaliated. Everywhere the camps and fortifications for which so many slave lives had been sacrificed were obliterated. The center of the Burgundian leadership, who had remained steadfast in their loyalty, proved unable to survive the fire, and vanished from the public eye."

Among the most decadent and morally and spiritually bankrupt of the nations of Europe, this degenerate pestilence has polluted the air of the continent for centuries too long. The outbreak of war in the Reich, while contrary to our initial plans, still provides us an opportunity to exercise a solution to the French problem.\n\nOur solution is to destroy France.

The roads and factories of France were all built by French hands to advance French interests, and those same hands shall now rebuild them—this time, to further the advancement of the German race. Those new, unwilling members of our state shall earn the oxygen and porridge that continues to sustain their lives through an act most uncommon to the French: honest labor. The soldiers that resisted us and the civilians that abetted them shall not be executed en masse, as they deserve, and shall instead be offered the opportunity to assist our regime by rebuilding and upgrading the infrastructure of the newly annexed territory of the Ordensstaat.

Those citizens of Ost-Paris who rejected us, and have attempted to flee to the west over the years, are now our clay to mold yet again. Many of the more prominent and most destitute of them will surely have to be liquidated—Eichmann has already begun his work—but the minds of the rest will be purified through diligent service to the Ordensstaat.

Most of the executions of the lower rungs were carried out on-site by our field personnel, the usual interrogation process prior to execution made unnecessary by the discovery of a treasure trove of information detailing the locations of several other cells all across our state. Anti-resistance operatives local to those areas are already on their way, and will likely arrive at the doorsteps of the few survivors long before they've heard word of their leadership's failure.\n\nThe ultimate ringleader of the resistance, a figure known as 'Grouès', is the last Red Poppy standing. Held under the strictest protective custody, his life was temporarily spared by a rare direct command from Reichsführer-SS himself. It would seem that the Reichsführer-SS desires to personally lay witness to the execution of this last remaining miscreant, and is presently on his way to the site in which Grouès is being kept. This exceptional course of events is indicative of the exceptional victory we have won today for the Aryan race. Finally, the rats are swept out, and our home is clean."

Consequently, those surviving members of the operation deemed not to have performed their duties adequately have been terminated. This is not the great victory we had hoped to achieve, but success may still await us in the future.

Red Poppy has struck a decisive blow against us, and we are frustratingly still at a loss as to how. Though treason within our ranks cannot be decisively confirmed, the threat of internal sedition is still too perilous to allow to linger. The anti-resistance operation is to be temporarily cancelled, and all personnel involved liquidated, to ensure that whatever caused this disaster to happen—either gross incompetence or high treason—does not ever happen again. In the meantime, the activities of the Red Poppy resistance will have to be a fact of life in the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund for the foreseeable future."

 burgundy_political.39.desc:0 "A man in a black coat walked hurriedly down a dark corridor, flanked by soldiers. The officers at the door opened it ahead of him, saluting the mostly strictly proper greeting as their superior strove past without acknowledgement. The sight of Heinrich Himmler in the flesh was not a common one for an SS officer, and they made sure to be on their best behaviour. There were severe consequences for anyone who lapsed in their discipline in the presence of Himmler.\n\nThe Reichsführer-SS did not usually deign to oversee the executions of prisoners personally. Truthfully, Himmler found death distasteful. The sight of gore disgusted him, and he was not present here just so that he could revel in it like some depraved sadist. He did not intend at all to prolong the dying of this prisoner; a gunshot to the back of the head was sure to be quick and clean. Himmler's personal attendance was purely one of ceremony, and poetry. This man, 'Grouès', was the leader of the resistance: the head of the body of the last group of truly free Frenchmen left alive. His death meant something—in dying, he would be the last breath of the French spirit. Ending his life would also destroy the soul of the nation that Himmler despised more than any other. He wasn't here to execute a man, he was here to execute France.\n\nSteel pressed against the prisoner's head, his body stood taut by guards. Himmler's gun nestled against his skull, ready to fire. His eyes drifted away for a second, his gaze turning from Grouès. That exact second was when he fired. He only needed to feel the kickback in his hand to know the man was dead. Himmler withdrew a cloth to clean his hands, and departed the room again. Thrill and pride and relief all washed over him in equal measure as he made his way back down the hallway. This time he stopped for a moment, halfway down the path, and looked back to make sure the guards had addressed him correctly. There was still more for the Reichsführer-SS to do."

Others were locals, natives of the conquered nations who had continued their resistance to the Schutzstaffel and its master for decades after their old nations they had capitulated. They had died, as they deserved. More important and more numerous than those, though, were the countless millions who had committed treason in their minds. Every peasant tending the fields or laborer working the factories who had ever thought, "Is this the life for me? Should I escape?" was now dead too.\n\nMany still seemed alive, of course. They breathed, and ate and slept. They did their daily labor. Maybe they even still had a stray errant thought. But the rebel inside them was dead, just the same as all the rebels who had ever taken up arms were dead. They were spiritually dead. The zeal of the Frenchman or the Belgian or any other dead country was gone from them. They did entertain for more than a moment the thought of resistance. They knew who was in charge, who ruled them. They understood their inferiority, even if in their minds they did not use that word. The people of the Ordensstaat now understood more than ever before who was their master, and why they should obey him. They were a population of two peoples now: good Aryan citizens, and empty husks. The latter would blow away like chaff in the wind over time, and from the mountains to the sea, the Aryan race would prosper under the wise rule of the Reichsführer-SS."

We must ensure that the future generations of the high and low races are made greater in rule and in service, in glory and in humility, in strength and in silence, than the degenerate legacy of our forebears have left them.\n\nThe SS Schulungs-und-Kulturamt has long been only nominally within our purview, full of independently minded servants of National Socialism doing essential yet often ignored work. Now we are making right this discrepancy. Ignorance is an enemy as ill-bred and repugnant as any Bolshevik menace, and slaying this beast, or worse, the beast of false-truth, is a fight worthy of a true Aryan.\n\nThe mind is a battleground between what the weak proclaim 'true' and what the strong know is correct.

We shall establish a special division to expunge France from all textbooks, with censor and propagandist working together we will banish the gross inequity of the past to make way for an uplifting future.\n\nFrance was never meaningfully independent from the Fatherland anyway. At most they were a satellite state, but in truth they have always been a vassal, a tributary, a subaltern to the Aryan race. The French SS officers who have joined since the establishment of the Ordensstaat will understand that this reflects a deep spiritual reality, that they themselves are not yet Aryan. They will be grateful for the lesson. Everyone shall be."

 BRG_das_landwirtschaftsamt_desc:0 "Although the Aryan race shall be able to live self-sufficiently once all decadence has been purged from the Vaterland and the people have been inculcated with true National Socialist thought, we are not yet there.\n\nUnfortunately, the Ordensstaat's food supplies are undergoing a brief availability bottleneck, one that must be addressed through the creation of a new body to better manage these valuable resources. It has been stressed to the Reichsführer-SS that these measures are only temporary and will be reversed once this roadblock to utopia is passed."
 BRG_food_for_factories_desc:0 "It matters not if our leaders have enough to eat if our entire industrial base collapses from starvation. We must make it our utmost priority to make sure that the workers at our most vital factories are properly fed in order to maintain production levels.\n\nWithin reason, of course. We don't want to give a Belgian slave in a camp factory the same quality of life as a German foreman or engineer. That would be madness!"
 BRG_a_simple_ration_desc:0 "In times of war (or similar distress), the idea of the "ration" varies between military and civilian life. For the former, they are dictated what meals they can eat and when. For the latter, they are still given plenty of leeway, and are only limited in their ingredients.\n\nBut why must it be this way? Why should the average workingman not be given the same guidelines as his comrade in the trench? Would it not serve the Volk if they were given the same kinds of nutritious, filling, and easy-to-produce meals?"
 BRG_specialized_assistance_desc:0 "Nowhere in the world have the fires of industry burned so hot as in the Ordensstaat. Momentous strides have been taken by the administration of the Reichsführer-SS and by the Aryan people to transform the Ordensstaat into the workshop of the world. With such a surge in industrial prowess has come the development of a large population of industrial specialists and logistical experts.\n\nWhilst their skills are most suited to industrial production, they may yet be rather effective in agricultural planning. As such, plans shall be drawn up to reorient German specialists to fine tune the fields rather than the forges, should the need soon arise."
 BRG_expand_rodomo_sillos_desc:0 "The Aryan man may labour tirelessly in his fields, reaping harvests unforeseen in their bounty. Yet, without the proper facilities to store the fruits of Aryan labor, it would all be for naught. The grain will rot and the German people will go hungry. Such a state of affairs shall not come to pass, as the Ordensstaat undertakes a grand expansion of the food storage and distribution network.\n\nThis network shall be centered around the facilities of Industriebezirk Rodomo, wherein the labourers shall erect large, central storage facilities, as well as distribution centers in tandem. Soon, agricultural yields shall go to waste no longer, as foodstuffs are distributed across the Ordensstaat in the most timely fashion."
 BRG_fields_of_grain_desc:0 "In order to feed the people of the Ordensstaat, agricultural yields must be increased. Of course, the land we tread upon is fertile, and ripe for agricultural purposes. Seizing the potential of our soil, however, will require no small deal of effort. To stave off disastrous famine, we shall construct large industrial farms, each tuned to reap the greatest outputs that the earth can provide.\n\nThe resources required for this undertaking shall be great yet necessary. Overgrown fields and untamed meadows shall be sown with grain as the silos of the Ordensstaat are made full once more. Such efforts will in most likelihood slightly slow our efforts at further industrialization, however, a laborer can offer no output should he fall dead by famine."
 BRG_food_for_those_who_matter_desc:0 "It matters not whether the people have enough to eat if the men guiding them are starving. If the Ordensstaat's leaders are malnourished, it risks putting everything that the Reichsführer-SS has worked towards in jeopardy. They will be sluggish and prone to error, and in the tense world of today, that cannot be tolerated.\n\nThe answer is clear, the leaders need to eat first. Starting with those the Reichsführer-SS has deemed to be of utmost priority, those of vital importance to the Ordensstaat shall have their daily fill."
 BRG_establish_priority_lists_desc:0 "The distribution of something as vital as food cannot simply be an ad hoc process. A comprehensive and standardized system is necessary in order to properly organize and maximize efficiency in the distribution of rations, while making sure that the most deserving get priority.\n\nEverything must be taken into account: age, rank, military activity, current office, past responsibilities, the state importance of their projects, recommendation from the Reichsführer-SS, no detail is too minor. The consequences are too large to leave anything up to chance."
 BRG_forget_outer_circle_desc:0 "Unfortunately, even within the SS hierarchy, there is not enough for everyone. The stocks are being depleted faster than some have projected, much to the chagrin of the Riechsführer-SS . He knows that some difficult decisions must soon be made about who will get limited supplies of high-quality food, and it is a sacrifice he is willing to make. After all, what is a more noble and virtuous way for an Aryan to suffer than for the good of his race and nation?"
 BRG_crack_the_whip_desc:0 "With the requisitioning of designated food supplies from the less desirable, and their re-allocation to those essential personnel who ensure that the Ordensstaat, we may rest assured that when food begins to run short and the apparatus of the state remain well fed, their loyalty will be without question.\n\nUntil then, there is much work to be done. From the laborers we must ask more, and from the people we must demand more service. Heightened quotas and increased conscription shall soon become necessary measures, and as such the people will inevitably become increasingly unruly. However, our loyal and well fed personnel shall ensure that the people do not get out of hand. We can rest assured of it."
 BRG_waste_not_or_want_not_desc:0 "With such a precious commodity being managed so carefully, the penalties for misappropriating it must be consequently adjusted to reflect its importance. To hoard and waste food in the middle of a declidate situation is the re-emergence of the same degenerate ideas that underpinned Jewish capitalism: using flawed judgement to place the individual's needs above those of the Volk.\n\nThe same approach must be taken. Negligent waste will result in arrest and interrogation by the Gestapo. Intentional waste or hoarding will merit a far more intensive process."
 BRG_emergency_stockpile_measures_desc:0 "Every able man is important to the Ordensstaat, yet some are more important than others. Senior officials, members of critical response groups and key state apparatus, and other such individuals instrumental to the plan of the Reichsführer-SS, must be preserved. As such, with a troubling famine looming closer upon the horizon with each passing day, we must take action to ensure that the resources are available to keep these personnel well fed. This will inevitably require the requisition of food allocations from those less deserving, who will face their reckoning in the coming struggles."
 BRG_develop_new_fertilizers_desc:0 "In the past, few things were more dangerous to a civilization than overfarming. They exploited the land to the point where it would make crops impossible to grow, and they would wither away and fade into history like the dying plants in the fields.\n\nThankfully, due to advances in the agricultural sciences, fertilizers allow farmers to restore the soil's nutrients and keep growing the same crops year after year. If the Ordensstaat is to survive and thrive, we must exploit this to the fullest extent."
 BRG_industrial_aids_desc:0 "National Socialists are not Luddites. Although they seek to preserve the physical and moral purity of the Aryan race through millennia, they recognize the value of modern industry and use it to better their environment. Agronomy is certainly no exception to this.\n\nThe traditional rural life of the future shall not be one with primitive farming implements. Plows and seed drills shall give way to tractors and combines."
 BRG_industriebauernhof_projekte_desc:0 "As industry was greatly expanded, this necessitated the centralization of the population into tight knit urban centers, so that men could work the newly built foundries and factories that dot the land. An ambitious urbanization effort was undertaken by the Ordensstaat, with many being incentivized or coerced into flocking to the cities. However, whilst a city may provide impressive outputs insofar as weaponry or industrial goods are concerned, it provides naught in terms of food, acting as a drain into which the Ordensstaat's food stores are offloaded.\n\nAs such, we are now faced with the difficult decision to roll back such initiatives, for the labourers are needed in the fields now more than ever. And they are needed with due haste. We will do what we must to drive the people back into the fields for now, even if we must demolish entire city blocks to achieve this."
 BRG_the_final_measures_desc:0 "The Ordensstaat has diligently undertaken all possible measures at its disposal to conquer the threat that the famine presents. The loyalty of essential personnel has been secured, the labor of the Volk intensified and mobilized, and previously untamed fields are now sown with grain.\n\nDespite all this, it was inevitable that those weaker and less deserving individuals in our society would perish in these hard times. It is no matter. Their mouths no longer need to be fed, and with this, our food stores shall soon begin to swell once again. With the weakest individuals sacrificed so that the Volk may be fed, and with the ingenious preparations orchestrated by the Reichsführer-SS, the famine shall soon be naught but a cold memory."
 BRG_a_second_try_desc:0 "The efforts undertaken by the Ordensstaat to stave off the great impending famine were monumental. Very few stones were left unturned in our quest to avoid troubling times. All appeared well, as our grain stores began to fill once again with fewer mouths to feed.\n\nYet it was not to last. The few stones that were left yet unturned have brought a reckoning upon the Ordensstaat, as famine has returned once more, like a painful memory come back to haunt the Aryan people. The few remaining stones from underneath which these troubles seep must be turned, regardless of cost."
 BRG_raze_the_cities_desc:0 "In order to meet the necessary quantities of grain to feed the populace in this increasingly complex crisis, radical measures must be taken. Measures which shall make all our prior efforts appear to be little more than token gestures. It begins with our centres of industry.\n\nWhilst the most industrious of our cities certainly produce well in the way of mechanical and industrial goods, it is undeniable that these regions also consume the most food, all the while producing none. If we are to solve this lingering famine in finality, we must raze these factories and pave the regions with great industrial farms, the likes of which are yet unseen in this world. We cannot dither in deciding between the grain or the cog. The cog will not feed the Aryan man nor will it nourish the laborer."
 BRG_survival_of_the_fittest_desc:0 "As the most radical of measures are undertaken, in the current short term we must face the disappointing fact that the food currently does not exist to feed all of the subjects of the Ordensstaat. As such, those who wish to be fed must prove their worth through a days' exceptional labour. Those who just get by and those who do not exert themselves to their maximum in all their labors shall simply not be fed. If prior enticements were not sufficient to encourage the workforce to produce good results, then surely the prospect of an empty stomach at the end of the day and an early grave shall act as a stronger encouragement."
 BRG_tighten_the_belts_desc:0 "Once before, when faced with famine, we had sufficient food in reserve to guarantee to the most essential and loyal soldiers of the Ordensstaat that they would be well fed and content. With the crisis growing ever more concerning, however, this may no longer be so. To ensure that all personnel have at the least something to eat, the rations of even the most loyal SchutzStaffel members must be cut. All, even the most crucial soldiers, must now do their part in self sacrifice for the cause."
 BRG_grab_it_all_desc:0 "Every day, those unworthy and unessential to the Reichsführer-SS's plans continue to fester within the Ordensstaat. Like a tapeworm, they feed upon provisions that were made to nourish the Aryan man. This will continue no longer. We will seize yet more provisions from those deemed unessential to the plans of the Reichsführer, so that those critical to the plan shall live. In the end of it all, the deaths of those being deprived do not matter."
 BRG_burgundian_diet_desc:0 "The German diet, the French diet, the Belgian diet. These are culinary traditions with hundreds of years' worth of influence, full of rich and vibrant characteristics that make them unique and treasured by chefs the world over.\n\nThey are also some of the most decadent, divisive, and un-Aryan ways of living ever known.\n\nIn this lean time, there is no room for sausages, chocolates, and fine wines. This must be a time of uniformity, a time of austerity, a time of singular devotion to the cause of the Reichsführer-SS's vision."
 BRG_nothing_shall_remain_desc:0 "As many essential individuals and German families throughout the Ordensstaat find themselves upon the brink of starvation, some seem to have scarcely taken notice. Many decadent bureaucrats and generals continue on with their needlessly excessive lifestyles, ignorant of the plight of the Ordensstaat. Lavish suppers, several course meals, desserts. For every one of their meals or functions, fifty aryan men could be healthily put to work.\n\nIt ends now.\n\nThis wastefulness will come to an immediate end. There may be backlash from the Charlemagne collaborators, but it matters not. Their pride and excessive living cannot stand, and their ire is much easier to face than the starvation of thousands of men essential to the plan."
 BRG_root_of_indulgence_desc:0 "As it turns out, there is, in fact, such a thing as wasteful food production. Indeed, not all food that is produced is conducive to our efforts at nourishing the Aryan people. With the inheritance of its territories, the Ordensstaat with it inherited the decadent established food industries so beloved by the degenerate Frenchmen. Cheesemaking. Wineries. All such lavish and excessive foodstuffs must be scuppered, for they are made irrelevant by grain and livestock. All focus must be put into those areas, and those areas alone. The Ordensstaat is not concerned with the fine dining of the fortunate few."
 BRG_some_can_stay_desc:0 "The Charlemagne collaborators, enriched in their cooperation with the Ordensstaat, are known for their lavish dining and decadent ways. Dinner parties and grand meals which could feed dozens of hard working Aryan men are instead swallowed by a fortunate few. It is revolting to think that for each time they dine, food is siphoned away from dozens of hard working Aryan men.\n\nHowever, the collaborators are regrettably essential to both the plan and the day to day operations of the Ordensstaat. We cannot risk their outright disapproval. As such, some of their particularly wasteful practices shall be disallowed, however nobody will pay a particularly watchful eye should they decide to continue with them regardless of regulation."
 BRG_needs_of_the_few_outwiegh_the_many_desc:0 "To further endear Charlemagne to the Reichsführer-SS, a proposal has been put forth: Grant the collaborators tracts of farmland to do with as they please, to feed themselves and their men, primarily. Of course, having large tracts of land from which we cannot extract the most efficient amounts of grain and livestock will reduce output greatly, and surely endanger the lives of many personnel who already rest upon the brink. Yet, despite what it shall cost in productivity and lives, the loyalty of Charlemagne is far more valuable."
 BRG_a_solved_problem_desc:0 "Finally, we may claim that no stone has been left unturned in combating the great famine. The Ordensstaat has undertaken all measures fathomable to ensure that in due time, the famine shall come to an end. As crops bloom and yields increase throughout the seasons, the troubles will come to an end in due time. That is not to say that our struggles have come to an end, for the famine will plague the Ordensstaat and its people for some time still. We simply need not worry, for now it is an issue which shall be guaranteed a resolution.\n\nFinally, we may turn our attention to the plans of the Reichsführer-SS, and do all we can with our current workforce before it continues to expire."

The Reichsführer-SS's plans allow for so many opportunities for culling the weak, the first of which concerns who is able to enter the bunkers in the first place. Although there are already lists of people considered to be of prime Aryan breeding stock, the lists must be further pruned by considering skillsets, loyalty to the Party, roles within the SS and the Ordensstaat, and other important factors to determine usefulness to the Volk."
 BRG_find_the_locations_desc:0 "As convenient as it would be, bunkers cannot be built everywhere. Those too close to a city become prime targets for enemy sabotage, not to mention the risk of damage by nuclear blasts. This need for a rural setting, plus the environmental conditions that are conducive to underground construction in the first place, significantly narrow down potential construction sites. However, necessity is the mother of innovation."
 BRG_project_bergentruckung_desc:0 "The locations have been finalized, the plans have been approved, and now the ground must be broken. Not just for the bunkers that will save the Aryan race from certain death, but also for the tools that will deliver a swift end to the lesser races of the world. Time is of the essence; the sooner that these are finished, the sooner the Reichsführer-SS's vision may be fulfilled."

Their importance cannot be understated, and their protection cannot be anything short of absolute. There can be no room for petty partisanship or the subversion of regionalists, and nothing in Heaven or Hell can be permitted to stop these from being built."
 BRG_hiding_the_silos_desc:0 "The ancients believed that in warfare, it was wise to appear weak to enemies so they would be unprepared for your true military might. And, as they often were, the ancients were right today. French spies, American planes, nosy German inspectors, Breton smugglers, and Swiss surveillance all pose a risk of uncovering the silos and revealing our intentions. This cannot be allowed."
 BRG_expanded_uranium_production_desc:0 "Just as a baker relies on a farmer to aid his livelihood, so does a missile rely on a mine. Enriched uranium does not grow on trees, and the lands of the Ordensstaat fortunately have enough to sustain a uranium mining operation. However, it can sustain more, and uranium is needed more than ever."
 BRG_the_grasping_hand_desc:0 "Now that the ground has been prepared, the construction of the bunkers themselves may begin in earnest. No expense shall be spared and no corner shall be cut, for these is no wiser investment than one in the future of the Aryan race.

 BRG_expanded_bunker_design_desc:0 "We have the time, we have the resources, we have the manpower, and we definitely have the will, so why not? Every fit and genetically viable Aryan who is saved is one more guarantee against the extinction of the human race's finest. It will also save the Reichsführer-SS and his staff from making uncomfortable choices about which racially pure loyalists to National Socialism deserve priority within the group."
 BRG_upgraded_ventilation_research_desc:0 "Mankind was not designed to live underground; cave-ins, stagnant airflow, and dangerous pockets of heavy gases conspire to make the miner or cave-dweller's life a short one. But the Aryan is able to adapt in both his body and his tools. The power of superior Teutonic engineering, plus a plethora of redundancies, shall make sure that the inhabitants of the bunkers can survive for a long, long time."
 BRG_finalize_the_evacuation_plans_desc:0 "The bunkers, however, are pointless if the plan to fill them is incomplete. Who is worthy of survival, and how they will reach salvation, are both secrets which must be kept closely guarded by those close to the Reichsführer-SS. The unworthy may try and slip in in a desperate attempt to save themselves, and the egocentric among them may take offense to their exclusion from the list."
 BRG_the_future_secured_desc:0 "At last, the Reichsführer-SS may rest easy. The bunkers are built, the lists are finalized, and the silos are filled and armed. Now all that remains is one question:\n\nWhen shall we pull the trigger?"

Kings and Queens rose, but all that remains is a horrible state of impotence for all who'd cause themselves Portuguese, and the Ordensstaat has come to understand the great level of potential in exploiting such inadequacies within the Union.

Thus, we shall begin moving our agents present in the Middle East towards securing a position of connection with the King, and provide for ourselves more and more riches as the drunken fool signs away Egypt's treasury to our coffers."

 BRG_globalplan_adler_desc:0 "The Reich, our beautiful, mighty Reich, has betrayed the German people and Aryan race it purports to champion. The sacred light of the black sun of national socialism grows dim as corruption, malice, greed, gluttony and statism causes our thousand year empire to crumble and fray at the edges, at any moment ready to be overrun by the circling hordes of subhumans. The Civil War was the final death blow for the Reich, this wounded eagle must be put down with the rest if we are to preserve the last true and pure here in the Ordenstaat. Still, we will rouse the giant one last time, try to guide her towards burying the eagle's claws in the foreigner as the end comes. We will see you in Valhalla."

 BRG_der_ruin_des_architekten_text:0 "Der Ruin des Architekten"
 BRG_der_ruin_des_architekten_desc:0 "Albert Speer is a strange and tragicomic creature. While on one hand he is supremely unsuited for the role of Führer, being soft-hearted and tending towards tolerating politically and racially questionable characters, he also differs from his opponents through genuine competence and recognition of the Reich's many failings. That is however also why he must be weakened and pushed towards a more hardline policy. We cannot risk having him trying to turn back the clock to 1932, or worse, seek detente with the Japanese and Americans. As such, as much as it pains us, we must rally the supporters of statism and degeneracy against his rule; for the good of the race the Volk must be allowed to slide further."
 BRG_stable_no_more_text:0 "Stable No Longer"
 BRG_stable_no_more_desc:0 "Due to Speer's weakness of character and courage, he has not dared properly purging the supporters of his opponents. While most of the handful of SS supporters have fled to us or into the vast Reichskommissariats, many of the bureaucrat fatcats of Bormann and armchair generals of Göring still waddle around the hallowed halls of Germania. We must extend a helping, and as anonymous as possible, hand to these poor lost souls and help push them to act against the new government."
 BRG_deform_his_image_text:0 "Deform the Führer's Image"
 BRG_deform_his_image_desc:0 "That insolent worm Speer has blamed the... cleansings of the war years on us in the SS. While this is not... wholly untrue, it is still a grave disrespect to the important work of the SS-Totenkopfverbande and other loyal servants of the Race. While we don't mind him blaming that useless sot Heydrich, it was his damn conference that started it all in the first place, he also names the Reichsführer, Adolf Eichmann, and many other prominent Burgundians as partakers in these actions. Our propagandists have prepared a wave of underground "newspapers" with articles instead blaming most of the mass death on Albert Speer's slavery system and brutal usage of the slaves. Let us see how he likes being slandered."
 BRG_polarize_the_climate_text:0 "Let the Sparks Fly"
 BRG_polarize_the_climate_desc:0 "Our initial propaganda campaign was highly successful, it is time to graduate our misinformation from just underground newspapers to anti-government posters and pamphlets. Let us see if Speer's limpwristed "government" has the strength to tear them down."
 BRG_support_the_wehwirtchaftsfuhrer_text:0 "Connection on the Inside"
 BRG_support_the_wehwirtchaftsfuhrer_desc:0 "We have identified an industrialist by the name of Friedrich Flick, once one of the Wehrwirtschaftsführers who considered themselves "friends of the Reichsführer" before our move to the Ordenstaat, and who was sympathetic to Heydrich during the Civil War. Speer have either foolishly failed to vet him or cowardly failed to purge him, because Flick retains his fortune, his conglomerate, and his immense influence in the economy. We must restore our ties with him promptly to undermine the False Führer's economic control."

 BRG_count_the_four_desc:0 "The decadent and degenerate government of the Judeo-Bolshevik rat Albert Speer may sit in Germania, but their hold on the Reich is precarious.  Using our resources, firepower, and intelligence, we are doing what we can to disrupt and dislodge Speer's reformist scum.  No matter how hard they try, they cannot bring down National Socialism.  We will make sure of it."
 BRG_target_rnd_text:0 "Trick the RND"
 BRG_target_rnd_desc:0 "Those fools in Speer's Reichnachrichtsdienst think they can weed out the spies in the Heimat? The idiots do not even realize we have men in their own offices! We will make sure that all of their training and resources go to waste by sending them on a wild goose chase."
 BRG_whatever_it_takes_text:0 "Whatever It Takes..."
 BRG_whatever_it_takes_desc:0 "There are certain benefits to Speer ascending to the Reichskanzellei; his reforms are extremely unpopular with almost all levels of bourgeoisie society and especially in the ranks of the Party. While it may be painful for us to directly harm the Reich, destabilizing his regime and loosing his grip on power will be extremely beneficial to our end goal of preventing his efforts for reconciliation. Vorwarts!"
 BRG_the_revolt_text:0 "The Revolt"
 BRG_the_revolt_desc:0 "The slaves in the Reich have revolted! While it is certain that in due time, even the degenerated Wehrmacht of Speer's Reich will put down the unwashed hordes rising against their masters, in the meantime the terrible publicity for the Führer and the panic among the propertied classes will ensure that confidence in the government hits rock bottom. We need to reach out to our friends in the German media and make sure as much of the propaganda as possible have critical attitudes to the government's handling, but not the Party or the Heer."
 BRG_load_schroners_die_text:0 "Load Schörner's Die"
 BRG_load_schroners_die_desc:0 "General Schörner is the most senior member of Göring's militarist faction still active in the political circles of the Reich. He is rightfully advocating taking a hardline stance against the revolting untermensch, and is highly critical of the government line. If we can leverage our grip in the media once more, we can ensure he is portrayed as a hero of the crackdown on the slaves and champion of Aryan supremacy, insulating him from any removal attempts and making him an unchallenged voice for a militaristic line."

This was a natural development of the competitive nature of the Party bigshots in the thirties, forties and fifties; everyone wanted a pet agency for collecting blackmail and secrets. We must ensure our spies and sympathizers are thoroughly infiltrated in as many of these services as possible, so that we can access this information, particularly about the many Party members we seek to control and direct towards supporting the government and our chosen businesses."

Flick's conglomerate and other loyal businesses will funnel money, equipment, materials and much else out of the Reich and into the Ordenstaat where it will shore up our own state. While their blackmail efforts are now less necessary, our spies in the German intelligence services will continue providing us with whatever info they can find on the internal situation of the Reich."

 BRG_the_militarist_text:0 "Göring's Turn"
 BRG_the_militarist_desc:0 "That bloated establishment toady Göring and his military supporters have secured their grip over Germania. While normally we would be loathe to endorse such a useless waste of uniform material, the fool tied his cause heavily to the militarist faction of the Party and their allies in the Wehrmacht. Our primary goal should thus be to champion the militarist cause to drive conflict, while simultaneously undermining the False Führer's authority by denying him easy victories and economic stability. Plans must be drawn up at once."
 BRG_equipment_to_their_enemies_text:0 "Equipment for their Enemies"
 BRG_equipment_to_their_enemies_desc:0 "The bloated carcass in the Reichskanzellei has finally been goaded into initiating offensive operations against whatever unfortunate countries the militarists want to loot that day. Sadly, with the Aryan might of the Wehrmacht marching against them, few European countries could stand against them for long. If we are to slow down Görings successes and exaggerate his failures, we must ensure his potential enemies get a solid donation of firearms and military equipment from the "French State." It will be technically correct since we are a state controlling part of France."
 BRG_failure_for_their_friends_text:0 "Failure for their Friends"
 BRG_failure_for_their_friends_desc:0 "An army marches on its stomach, so with some strategic raids by "partisans" on the Heer's supply lines we can ensure the soldiers stay hungry, disgruntled, short on ammunition and are left generally in poor combat condition. Even if they still win, the road there will be long and tortuous, the blame pointing squarely at Germania."
 BRG_focus_on_weakspots_text:0 "Find the Weak Links"
 BRG_focus_on_weakspots_desc:0 "On the surface Göring's support base seems solid, but in reality many of his supporters view him with skepticism, for example the militarist leader, General Schörner. We must map out these voices and ensure their influence is strengthened both in the Party and Army, to push the Reich towards more aggressive policies."
 BRG_cut_the_strings_text:0 "Slash the Chains"
 BRG_cut_the_strings_desc:0 "With Göring's critics located and strengthened, we can begin taking active measures to split and weaken his support base. Before long, the Hero of the Luftwaffe will be the hero of very few with real power and influence."
 BRG_goodbye_goering_text:0 "Goodbye Göring"
 BRG_goodbye_goering_desc:0 "The False Führer's influence is diminishing by the day, he is now little more than a puppet of the militarists, left playing his incompetent games with the economy like a toddler locked in his room. With our newfound experience with leveraging the militarist network, we can drag him down even further into irrelevance."

 BRG_another_shots_desc:0 "We need to provide more solid equipment this time around. Mortars, anti-tank grenades, shells... anything we can spare from the French armories we looted during our war with them. It is critical that the Wehrmacht keep getting bogged down in brutal fighting."
 BRG_another_road_block_text:0 "Another Roadblock"
 BRG_another_road_block_desc:0 "To improve the raiding of our "partisans", they will now be equipped with detailed maps of the logistics storehouses, machineguns to help suppress a potential counterattack by the guards, and plastic explosives to destroy anything that cannot be stolen. Things will not be easy for the Reich's soldiers."
 BRG_prepare_for_our_turn_text:0 "The Final Plan"
 BRG_prepare_for_our_turn_desc:0 "Somehow, Göring has managed to achieve his goals so far, albeit at a great cost to the Reich. To our joy, our spies in the Oberkommando now report that the delusional militarists are planning grand conquests for world domination that our foreign policy analysts pretty much guarantee will lead to a new world war. All we really need to do is make sure they are encouraged to continue."
 BRG_der_entruckung_text:0 "Der Entrückung"
 BRG_der_entruckung_desc:0 "It appears the latest target for Göring's wild ride of military conquest is... the Ordenstaat. This is unfortunate, but not unexpected. The Oberkommando in Germania is fearful about our nuclear arsenal, which we can use to our advantage. If we can rush the SS into German territory, local silo commanders or even the Oberkommando themselves might panic and order the deployment of part of their nuclear arsenal. With how tense the Americans and Japanese are over German resurgence, that should be more than enough to trigger a global conflict. We must ready ourselves for Rapture, Ragnarök is upon us!"

So great is the extreme putridity characterizing the Reich that it fell into its own horrific Civil War, pitting the Germanic Master Race against itself in a horrific gladiatorial arena throughout the Reich. Now, however, only one false Führer stands to call themselves leader of the Aryan people, gutting the strength of the Germanic people even more as they feed the bloated corpse of the Reich more lies every passing day in order to maintain the survival of their unholy power. However, while this sickly beast continues to crawl through the mud of this world to try to find power, the Ordenstaat poised to strike, ready to do all we can to bring down this fallen behemoth who once dared called themselves the masters of this solemn world. And with how deranged the country has become, it shall not be long until they aid greatly towards the Reichsführer-SS's plan..."

 ###Events

 BRG_adler.1.t:0 "Shadows on the Rail"
 BRG_adler.1.d:0 ""Agents Ten, Twelve, Thirteen, Thirty-Three, make way upon the railing above." Echoed the earpieces of the Aryan servants of the Ordenstaat's shadow. Thus, the men descended from the roof onto the dark balconies above, hidden away under the shadow of the night as their rifles came ready to use upon the floor below. \n\nThe factory doors came to a crash as the men entered the room, ready to meet just whoever so happened to have contacted the legendary Businessman of the Reich at this time of the night. "Uh, hello, anyone there?" said the Businessman, in the most regal attire of a trenchcoat as his guards smoked cigars. \n\n"Good evening, Herr Flick." echoed a voice from the darkness, as a man took a few paces to greet the entourage upon their entrance into the area. "Supposing, at this time of the night, you'd enjoy the skipping of pleasantries so that business may be conducted?" the man said, adorned in mystery. Flick shook his head slowly in response. "Well, then allow me to begin. You see, there are elements of this world which lurk under the watchful eyes of Dictators, Generals, the Reich, and even the Führer himself, Herr Flick. Elements of this world which would like to see themselves involved in the meandering of Speerian governing, and are willing to pay handsomely for it." The man said, opening a briefcase full of Reichsmarks. \n\nWith the dark room laid to silence, Herr Flick continued to ponder the question for just a few minutes, until finally, his eyes brightened up. With a shaking of hands, the Reichsmark were taken that day, and the Ordenstaat had a way straight to Speer's heart. \n\n"Alright, gentlemen, lay down your rifles." the Man said, as the clambering of military gear being set down began."
 BRG_adler.1.a:0 "Terror to some, greatness for us."

 BRG_adler.3.t:0 "The Facade of a Million Shadows"
 BRG_adler.3.d:0 "The Office of the Führer deep within the Halls of Germania was once embellished with the great calls for glory from the illustrious Adolf Hitler, the marching, arm-locked-in-arm, of Generals discussing the glory of the Reich's conquests, and the countless citizens of Germania enjoying, for themselves, the Empire which gave them dominion over the world. Now, however, the Führer himself lies in silence, begging himself not to take another cigarette in fear of his health, hand clasped in hand, as he stares into the distance, telephone in hand. \n\n"My Führer, the ongoing protests within several of the Reich's universities are not, I repeat, not at the hands of remaining Civil War elements. A series of documents have been circulating to the public, sir. A series of documents about you, my Führer." the voice said gravely over the telephone. \n\n"What do they say, Gruppenführer?" Speer said, being met with a few moments of silence. "Gruppenführer, what the hell did they say?" the Führer said, in a mix of terror and great, seething anger. \n\n"Sir, they. They discuss information regarding your participation in the extended extermination of non-Aryans over the course of the Second World War and the years following." The military leader said, sending the painful shiver of horror straight into the void that made up the Führer's soul. "Students are responding in organization over the issue, asking you directly for answers, my Führer." \n\nThe realization of the painful setback of progress for the Reich shook Speer. No longer could he work towards securing his position of leadership in the Reich riding upon the pure faith of the reformists without answering towards the untold truths which lie at his feet. What has begun must be dealt with as always, however."
 BRG_adler.3.a:0 "I will handle it personally, Gruppenführer."

 BRG_adler.4.t:0 "A Devoted Soul"
 BRG_adler.4.d:0 ""So, Herr Flick, you have provided that, under the direct submittance of an additional seven and a half million Reichsmarks, that you shall be within immediate compliance towards general coordinated statements forwarded by our office, am I correct?" the icy, rasped voice of the Reichsführer-SS echoed out over the telephone towards the Businessman of the Reich. \n\n"National Socialism brought greatness to the Reich, it made the Reich whole. I am more than willing to do what I can as a true patriot to the German country and her people and stave off Speer's corruption; however, I simply have a few questions. Firstly, what will I be doing in accordance with our agreement, what do I have to do to ensure we do right by the Reich?" Flick said, meeting silence on the other end of the line. "And what about anonymity? My name is going to be scratched off of any documents regarding our deals and whatnot, correct?" Flick asked again. Meanwhile, the phone line continue to meet his expectations with a droning monotone. \n\n"You will find out soon, Herr Flick, but do not worry: no one shall know of our deals, and the millions you have earned from them." the Reichsführer-SS stated, as the phone line hung up. Six hundred miles apart from one another, both men took steps back from their chair, and readied themselves for the coming future."
 BRG_adler.4.a:0 "His patriotism shall be our gain."

 BRG_adler.5.t:0 "Bloody Ferdinand's Escape"

Kessler said, as he continued to stare straight at the map below him on the table. \n\n"What the fuck are you talking about, Kessler? Twenty-Six hours ago, right after they went on patrol when they lost this monster, remember the damn report?" Wedekind said. \n\n"That's what I mean. Get a report from them, now. Find where they are, who they're with, their names, everything." Kessler said, as Wedekind confusingly went off to fulfill the task at hand. An hour later, the creaky door opened back into the investigation room as Wedekind made his way back into the room, report in hand and sunken eyes to match. "What's it say?" Kessler said. \n\n"Killed. Slaves got them, every last one of them, beat them to death with a few stab wounds in each." Wedekind responded. \n\nThe two men sat in a cold, silent anguish over the thoughts of what happened. That was before Kessler shot out his chair and grabbed Wedekind. "Wedekind, you listen here and you listen close. Look at that map and tell me, where in the Hell did slaves come out of nowhere when their nearest compound is dozens of miles away?" Kessler said, filling Wedekind with a great fear of the unknown."

And, as  if on cue by the grand director of this wretched life, Ernst Kaltenbrunner came in, manilla folder in hand. "Glory to the Reichsführer-SS." stated the Nazi towering over the desk, offering his greatest Nazi salute. "Sir, these cold mornings have allowed for us a great victory in the fall of the succumbing Reich." he said, handing his superior the folder. \n\nAs the papers flipped by, the Reichsführer-SS continued to understand the meaning of these messages. That Fat Pig claiming to be the Führer as he waddled around, medallions in hand, is marching onward towards a new Grand War Strategy, dubbed "War Plan B," dedicated towards the annexation of further territories in the ravaging quest for new splendors for the Reich in their new failure. The Turkish, the Iberians, the Italians, the Russians, the Syrians, and the Africans would all come to meet a wall of the Reich's soldiers if all would go according to the plans of the decadent Hermann Göring. \n\n"Return to your duties, Herr Kaltenbrunner." the Reichsführer-SS said, as his underling marched off. Finally, it was time for the Ordenstaat to begin the immediate production of arms and equipment for these nations, and finally get involved with a little "foreign aid" in order to play catch up with the Reich's forward motion, and ensure their collapse comes yet."

"Our agents have discovered immediately pertinent intelligence regarding the Führer's plan with the Ordenstaat, sir." He said, shifting the thick manilla folder towards the Reichsführer-SS's face. \n\n"I shall handle this personally, Herr Kaltenbrunner. You are dismissed, for now." the Reichsführer-SS said, as Kaltenbrunner shut the iron door behind him. Opening the document in front of him, the Reichsführer-SS's eyes' meeting of the words "Fall Schwarz" brought a great discovery to his mind... \n\nThe greatest key to the Plan he has ever found. \n\nThus, the Reichsführer-SS prepared. Yes, it was true that this a great discovery for the benefit of the future; however, how could he hope to achieve success if the plans were not in place? Allowing the Reich to run over and invade the Ordenstaat was an obvious impossibility if he sought to enact the Plan. Thus, he would have to prepare the great and mighty Aryans of the Ordenstaat to pledge every single man, every single resource, and every single bullet, towards waging a great war with the Rech.

"The Russians had just enough explosives planted in their retreat to make it work, and took out a swathe of my man, and left me blind in my left eye for quite some time. But the Aryan does not give in, Mr. Hewel, he does not give up." The SS-Gruppenführer stated, causing the Foreign Minister of the Bormann administration to roar with laughter and giddiness towards the tale of war and bloodshed. "You are one mighty creature, Gruppenführer, a Lion in the company of Mice! Please, here is my personal office's telephone number, do be sure to call and we can talk anytime, they give me whatever I want up there, and you can get well paid in turn!" said Hewel, as he got up from the leather chair and walked away to grab more food, as the SS-Gruppenführer called \n\n"Sir, I would request one favor of you." he said to the listening Walther Hewel. "Stay evermore devoted to the glorious Führer Bormann, a true patriot." Hewel offered a smile and nod as he walked off. The SS-Gruppenführer, however, could not understand the nature of the operation. Why would the Reichsführer-SS desire to support the foundations of these idiots? Hewel could hardly keep himself contained and became a walking embarrassment over a small story of War in the West, how could we support these degenerates? The Reichsführer-SS must have a plan, and faith will be required if he sought the will to maintain this position and earn the Ordenstaat an inside to this entire spider web in the Reich."

Everyday, incoming military, political, and economic reports gave new and rising situations regarding the Reich and her troubles, whilst the Führer himself offered estimations and calculations about how to conceptualize fixes for all these messes. One such mess required not fixing, yet still occupied Bormann's mind for quite some time: what was going on to cause the recent outspoken support from so much of the Administration, especially in a perilous time like this? \n\n"My Führer! Just the man I wanted to see!" said the Foreign Minister, Walther Hewel, as he crashed through the office. "I just had the most wonderful conversation at the Party Rally yesterday, sir, and I was reminded of just what I needed to do!" the Minister said, loudly for this time in the morning. \n\n"Ah, really? And what is it that you must do at a time like this, Hewel?" Bormann asked with a degree of annoyance and scorn as he lit a cigarette. \n\n"Well, sir, that's just it: it's you! The mighty Führer, Martin Bormann, who saved the Reich from collapse and preserved the legacy of the mighty Adolf Hitler! You have made our lives and prosperity possible, and no one seems to be cheery enough to say that anymore, sir! Thank you, and, remember, my office is always free to offer you what I can provide!" Hewel said, as he pat Bormann on the back and left. \n\nAnd there it was again. Another leader in the administration, overjoyed at everything Bormann was doing. This couldn't be right: the Reich was still facing issues, and as much as Hewel may be a fool, he wasn't just so easily able to overlook that. What was going on with the administration to flood these compliments? Then again, perhaps, the Führer thought to himself, maybe it was just time to offer himself some more credit for once."

However, he knew a great deal more about the terror able to be enacted by the phantoms he was surrounded with, whether it be the soul-draining nature of Speer's corruption, or the paralyzing fear of the men he worked with now. Thus came the terror as the Businessman turned and saw the the Scarred Giant of the Schutzstaffel enter the office. \n\n"Good evening, Herr Flick." spoke the menacing voice that flowed through the Giant. \n\n"Obergruppenführer Kaltenbrunner, it is an honor." stated Flick, with a slight hint of mistruth as his terror ensured the tension of the meeting. \n\n"Sit down, Herr Flick. We have much to discuss." said Kaltenbrunner, as he came around to sit beside the Businessman. "Herr Flick, it has come under the understanding of your devotion to the cause of National Socialism, and your willingness to support the cause through the tragedies of the modern day which harm it so greatly. Thus, in accordance with your transactionary deals, your immediate orders are to cede as great a percentile of operations for your industries towards Führer Bormann's regime immediately." Kaltenbrunner said. \n\n"This is an outrage, those are my profits, my hard earned business success! How could we support that fool in times like these, this is treachery, this is an insult!" shouted Flick. \n\n"Herr Flick, you will understand the orders you have been provided and see they come into fruition or else face the bylaws of our contract." stated Kaltenbrunner as the two SS guards in the back took a step forward. As Flick sat back down, he could not help but cede his own will to the Scarred Giant across from him."

 BRG_adler.16.d:0 "The pleasing mild successes accomplished by the Führer and his administration, managing to keep a smile plastered onto the people's faces had been assailed by a new confusing issue. The Führer continued to look onward, enjoying his organization and structure as a Master of the Bureaucrats, and, yet, something was wrong. Very wrong. As Bormann searched and scurried through his office, running his hand over every drawer and cubby, something was gone. \n\nMissing. \n\nSeveral things were. Yet, also, things that weren't here at the last point the Führer had come into his office had made their way onto his shelves and cases, when his secretary hadn't requested file transfers or anything of the sort! The matter brought sweat to the already-hardworked Führer's forehead, as the panic and confusion and paranoia of dissent and trickery plagued his mind. No, this couldn't have been, this was a simple trick, a mistake in the wake of the Führer's great work across the Reich taking up so much of his own time. However, in that slight chance, what if it truly is someone else instead? The Führer knew not, as he set his pen down and grasped his face, trying to ease his tensions."

These manifest in holes in the integrity of the corporatist hierarchy, corrupt fascists willing to tear themselves open for counterfeit lire.

 BRG_wolf_ensure_tension_desc:0 "Within the flames and dust of the Oil-strucken, blood-splattered Middle East, a new faction has arisen in an attempt to break the yoke of the decadent Italian Empire and establish for itself a Democratic Republic born out of a nationalistic idealism seeded within the roots of corruption, disgust, and a false sense of blood-given superiority, unbeknownst to their great subservience to the mighty Aryan. However, what this front of United Arabs do provide is radical notions to dispose of Italian influence in the Middle East, and with radicalism comes the next great massacre, with the blood of martyred warriors painting the steps towards the Vision of the Reichsführer-SS. Furthermore, the extreme gaps in unification of beliefs means that a victory would lead to a greater collapse of their hold of the entire Middle East, driving this world further into the crash it has dug itself into after so many years of depravity and decadence and further into fanning the flames of war."
 BRG_wolf_batten_down_the_hatches_text:0 "Batten Down The Hatches"
 BRG_wolf_batten_down_the_hatches_desc:0 "The Aryan's mighty claim to be the Masters of War above the rest of the subhuman degenerates which make up the landscape of the Earth sits as a valid and verified claim throughout the chronicles of history. Whereas the Arabs fighting the war know nothing of Aryan Supremacy upon the battlefield, a simple few members of the Master Race could easily turn the tide of the Oil Crisis and the many battles against the demoralized and weakened Italian soldiers. And, if sending out our courageous Germanic warriors to settle the conflicts our mutual interests seem to be failing in, then such a deployment is what we shall commence. However, to send in full units of the Ordenstaat's men would be diplomatically ruinous, not to mention disastrous for potential openings into our clandestine operations. Thus, we shall disguise our regiments as foreign mercenaries hired by our aided parties or as foreign volunteers sending themselves off in service of "the cause." Yes, they shall all be working towards a cause, to be assured; yet, it shan't be the one these countless cowards in the Middle East are fighting for."

BRG_Unglueing_Russia_desc:0 "There is a saying in America: "to put lipstick on a pig," meaning that merely changing the appearance of something beastly does not change its true nature. Similarly, you cannot put a suit on a bandit and turn him into a bureaucrat. As is to be expected from untermenschen whose collective minds have been warped by decades of socialist rule, the Russians are ultimately clueless when it comes to administration, bureaucracy, or economics. They will likely crash and burn without our intervention, but it would save much trouble if we sped up the process..."
BRG_Thawing_Wastes_desc:0 "Siberia is a land of endless steppes, frozen taigas, and little else of value beyond that. However, it is dominated by weak warlords with delusions of grandeur, and a more united Russia is a more threatening Russia to the Reich. By leveraging ties to the old collaborator Vladimir Romanov's networks in Vyatka, we may steer the rulers of the frozen hellholes toward ruin, and hopefully eventual absorption by their western neighbors."
BRG_throwing_off_the_plan_desc:0 "NIkolai Bukharin was a dreamer, and he often crossed the line into delusion. The greatest of his follies was the "Siberian Plan," which would somehow transform that barren snowdrift into an industrial powerhouse. Though is efforts were ultimately incapable of stopping the might of the Reich in the 1940s, it nonetheless left plenty of fun toys for the local warlords to discover and play with. If these machines broke, then the Siberian leaders would be left practically defenseless. What a pity."
BRG_The_Reassembled_Disaster_desc:0 "Out of all the Russian barbarians, those in West Russia are currently the closest thing that godforsaken country can offer to an existential threat to the Reich. Their hordes may be our best hope for sparking a war with the Reich and fulfilling the Reichsführer-SS's vision, but that does not mean we should make it easy for them.\n\nIn fact, we should make it even harder. Sabotage any mule-drawn wagons that pass for supply lines, and sow chaos among those old farmers in shacks they call a government. Let them bleed as much as possible on their way to Germania."
BRG_Strenghen_Their_Resolve_desc:0 "The southern Ural Mountains, despite having little strategic value, are nonetheless former Soviet territory, so the other warlords are slavering at the thought of annexing them. However, they have shown a remarkable degree of restraint for their kind, and have suggested peaceful annexation in lieu of invasion.\n\nIf the negotiations were to fail, however, then war would surely follow. The mountains are treacherous, and many thousands would needlessly die over some scraps of land. That would be such a terrible outcome..."
BRG_enflame_their_tempers_desc:0 "The most powerful armies in Russia are starting to take on the trappings of actual governments, holding meetings and conferences to consider the possibility of peaceful unification. More than twenty years of infighting and warlordism may soon come to an anticlimactic end, with naught more than a few strokes of a pen.\n\nBut that ending would not be true to their nature. The Russians are a violent and savage people, and their attempts at civilized behavior cannot withstand even the slightest of outside interference. Let us spark the occasional minor incident, and we shall prove them to be the beasts they have always been."
BRG_A_Prospurous_Bet_desc:0 "Of all the warlords in Western Russia, it was the self-proclaimed Tsar Vladimir, ruling from the city of Vyatka, who proved triumphant. He was also the only one whose government proved sufficiently manipulable by the Sicherheitsdienst to further the ends of the Ordensstaat and the Reichsführer-SS. Little does the Tsar know, but he is acting in a far greater service to the Aryan race than he ever did as an official collaborator.\n\nThe bet was successful and paid dividends. Time to raise the stakes."
BRG_The_Only_True_Government_desc:0 ""
BRG_Stoke_Their_Anger_desc:0 "Beneath the Tsar sit a legion of rabid nationalists and returned White émigrés, all of whom rant and rave about the injustice of other warlords and the dreaded Teutonic menace continuing to rule over Russian soil. However, their rage is often tempered by their more level-headed colleagues, who recommend as much preparation as possible before attacking the Reich.\n\nBut what if cooler heads don't prevail? A few well-placed agitators could easily shift their focus westward and boil their blood, bringing war to the Reich's doorstep as soon as possible."
BRG_Underground_Shipments_desc:0 "Vladimir's ramshackle empire has an economy that practically runs on vodka fumes. IF they are to have any hope of waging their envisioned war against the Reich, they need to be on more solid financial footing. A sudden influx of spare capital may be just what they need...\n\nOf course, their economy won't be bolstered to the point where they have a serious chance of winning, but enough to where the threat they pose is legitimate."


BRG_The_Coming_Inferno_text:0 "The Coming Inferno"
BRG_The_Coming_Inferno_desc:0 "Russia has, with a relative minimum of foreign aid, managed to push itself out of the swamp of anarchy into which it has been sinking for twenty years, and a more or less stable government has been established across its vast lands. An impressive feats for the Slavs to overcome their nature like that, and now fifty million Russians hunger for revenge and to push the Reich out of Moskowien. War is coming, and we will ensure that the corrupted Aryans of the Reich and the lower races of the Russias wipe each other out in the wars to come."

BRG_Lay_Down_The_Gunpowder_text:0 "Lay Down the Gunpowder"
BRG_Lay_Down_The_Gunpowder_desc:0 "The Russians do not exactly need to be told to hate the German people, but they can be helped along towards conflict. Luckily Heydrich and Eichmann made sure we had plenty of video tapes and photos of what our einsatz squads did to civilians in Western Russia from the beginning of the first war. Making sure such evidence arrives to the nascent Russian media will no doubt fire up the populace and drive them towards war, especially if coupled with some choice attacks on the border cities by "German saboteurs.""

BRG_Pour_On_The_Gas_text:0 "Pour On the Gas"
BRG_Pour_On_The_Gas_desc:0 "The surviving Russians are considerably outnumbered by the citizens of the Reich, even if their relatives in Moskowien rise up with them. Their industry is also sub-par. If want to convince the Russian government that they are ready for conflict, we should ship them every gun we have that isn't a German make, presenting it as gifts from an international coalition of resistance movements or some such. That should help pour gas on the fires of war."

BRG_Light_The_Fuse_text:0 "Light the Fuse"
BRG_Light_The_Fuse_desc:0 "With another West Russian War seeming more and more likely, we must prepare to ensure it is desperate as possible for the Reich, to encourage Germania to deploy their nuclear arsenal against the untermensch. Contacts should be made with Russian resistance groups in Moskowien and Ukraine, maybe even among the surviving natives in Ostland. Supply lines must be mapped out and prepared for sabotage, fresh water supplies must be poisoned."


 BRG_globalplan_bar_desc:0 "The situation in western Russia is at once both a great victory for the Reich and a humiliating example of the destitution wrought upon the Vaterland by the corruption that festers in Germania. On one hand, the blighted steppes and scorched forests of Western Russia—full of bombed out cities and collapsed into a menagerie of petty statelets—is a testament to the rightful fate of all that would stand against the invincible will of the Aryan race. Yet, on the other hand, the abject failure of the incomponent Reichskommisariat Moskowien to maintain the Reich's frontier against these subhuman raiders represents not only a material loss of living space for the Aryan people, but also an example of the types of calamity to befall the Vaterland since the exile of the Schutzstaffel to the Ordensstaat. Any patriotic citizen of the Reich could not help but sympathize with us after gazing upon such carnage; perhaps a few of the local untermenschen might be made to align themselves with our cause, too."

 BRG_Keep_Them_Divided_desc:0 "Communism is the most wholly detestable ideology to ever exist. It is a mental carcinogen, and if not excised it will spread and proliferate, polluting the thoughts of every race afflicted by its pestilence. Thankfully, providence has offered the Aryan race an undefeatable protection against this incurable malady: National Socialism. It is our ideological purity that will enable us to destroy the West Russian Revolutionary Front, just as the once pure Reich felled its predecessor all those years ago.\n\nSecond to their ideological depravity, the greatest weakness of the West Russian Revolutionary Front is their persistent factionalism. The three strongest personalities of the WRRF at present—Altunin, Zhukov and Tukhachevsky—hail to three different strains of communist thought, and are wholly willing to kill one another and ruin all that there is left to ruin of their meagre states if it shall see to the end of their rival 'comrades'. This is a most exploitable weakness; it will require only scarce efforts to fan the flames of mutual hatred enough to keep the competing leaders of Bolshevism focused on petty internal disputes rather than expanding their power base in time to stave off their execution by our regional assets."
 BRG_Northern_Light_Show_desc:0 "The Republic of Komi has learned entirely the wrong lesson from the Second World War. Whilst the peoples of Europe proper largely took the Reich's victory against the western liberals and eastern Bolsheviks as proof of National Socialism's superiority, the untermenschen of Komi have decided to swap from one failed system to another, abandoning their nation's empty communist rhetoric in favour of empty democratic rhetoric. Contemporary Komi is now plagued by all of the same chronic instability and rampant sedition that has always epitomized their adopted system, and their rotten labor in attempting to induce 'democracy' now offers us the sweet fruit of plucking their republic as an apple from a tree. There is barely any more discord left to sow in Komi, but our agents will not fail in finding yet more pandemonium to precipitate. When death comes knocking on Komi's door, it will all but fall off at the hinges."
 BRG_The_Tsar_desc:0 "Western Russia presents a unique puzzle for the Ordensstaat. Our goals in the region are twofold, and would seem to counteract one another. First, we must mould out of the chaos and charnel pits of the Russian heartland a strong regional power to serve as a counter-balance to the Reich in the east. This intermediary must be strong enough in the interim to both unite the other fledgling Russian states together as well as to put a lasting end to the contemptible and thoroughly deficient Reichskommissariat Moskowien, which has failed for a generation to hold the Vaterland's line against the Slavic hordes. Secondly, this new emerging power must both not have any designs on the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund itself and lack the kind of ideological inclination that would render it likely to become a threat to the Schutzstaffel in the future.\n\nAs luck would have it, an obvious candidate fulfilling both criteria presents himself. The warlord of Vyatka, a descendant of the deposed Russian monarchy who self-styles himself as Tsar, is a promising candidate for our machinations. The Tsar has even rendered aid upon the Führer once before, allowing himself to be utilized during the defeat of the Bolsheviks as a propaganda tool to enlist Russians to fight against the Red Army. Fatefully, Vyatka has recently commenced the construction of a major river port in the city, allowing us to implant several useful agents into the area covertly, to enact our future plans. The first step will be simple influence gathering; having a man inside the port facilities themselves would be extremely helpful to our future interventions there."
 BRG_The_Brotherhood_desc:0 "The forces at work in the chaos of western Russia are a microcosm of all those ideological enemies of the Aryan race that pollute the Earth. Every creed that has ever been written and every poison that has ever been drunk can be found carved into the insides of the bear's corpse, from the decadent perversions of the most extreme forms of liberalism to the soul-corroding aberrations of strict religious dogma. Communists are not the only enemies of the Vaterland: the status quo plutocrats and the misguided theocrats must also all be exterminated if we are to make the world good and pure. Most disturbingly of all, a few of the ignorant untermenschen would even dare to call themselves National Socialists...\n\nUnlike the comparatively prominent powers in Arkhangelsk and Vyatka, these least of the Russian lesser powers are not even really worth anything to us as tools to achieve the end of someone else; they are simply lambs to the slaughter, bodies and hills to be given to the stronger powers around them. They deserve a most humiliating death, and there is no end to life more impure than to fall at the hands of your own subjects. The so-called "Aryan Brotherhood" will be punished for the insolence of their namesake with the incitement of a mass slave revolt across their territory, armed and orchestrated by our agents. SS provocateurs will slip into the Brotherhood's cities by night, sabotaging the laborer's enclosures and arming those who deign to fight rather than flee. Let no Russian ever again dare to call himself 'Aryan'."
 BRG_The_Samaran_Question_desc:0 "Vlasov began his military career as a partisan for the Red Army, aiding communist forces in conquering Russia for communism. After his defeat at Moscow by the Wehrmacht, he turned traitor and joined forces with the Reich to lead those elements of the Russian population choosing to fight for the Führer. From the beginning, his loyalty to the Vaterland was always highly questionable. A Slav, and a communist besides, Vlasov did not deserve to remain alive after the completion of the war; he served his purpose until the collapse of Judeo-Bolshevik forces in the east, and since then has simply been a squatter, using those German-equipped Russian soldiers that fought alongside him to turn himself into just another one of the petty Russian warlords. He deserves to meet the same fate as the rest.\n\nA dissident in Vlasov's army, Oktan, is preparing to launch a coup in Samara. We will aid him, generously, in this insurrection. Oktan will soon find his manpower and equipment mysteriously bolstered, and that of Vlasov's loyalist forces suddenly at their weakest. He would be a fool not to take advantage of our gift, regardless of its source. Let us demonstrate to General Vlasov the fate that befalls all those who rise to power through treachery."
 BRG_The_Freikorp_desc:0 "The blighted steppes and scorched forests of Western Russia—full of bombed out cities and collapsed into a menagerie of petty statelets—stand as testament to the rightful fate of all that would stand against the invincible will of the Aryan race. This same state of chaos, wrought upon the Slavs by our predecessors, will now reap mighty rewards for the Ordenstaat. The sordid state of local infrastructure and bureaucracy and generalized lack of order in the Russian hinterland allows us to move men and material throughout the land as we please, without many questions asked about the origin of this or that infantry brigade or weapons cache. If anything, local authorities in Vyatka would be all too delighted to find a collection of expertly armed and trained soldiers arriving at their doorstep, ready to offer themselves in service to their 'beloved' Tsar.  We'll just have to do something about the German accents."
 BRG_Infiltrate_The_Okhrana_desc:0 "If any of the fighting men in service to the Tsar in Vyatka could be called elite, it would be the Okhrana. These guardsmen of the Emperor, responsible for maintaining internal order in the Tsardom, represent the best possible method for the Ordensstaat to influence the political and military development of Vyatka in the extremist position we would design for it. Being as our agents in Vyatka far exceed the martial abilities of any of the local subhumans, it should not be difficult to have them admitted to the Okhrana on merit. Still, if the Tsar's guardsmen are too suspicious of their new friends, a few valuables stuffed into the right shirt pocket should be more than enough to make up for it. Just as the Praetorian Guard in Ancient Rome so heavily impacted the political affairs of the Romans, so too shall the Okhrana—under our illicit control—impact the political affairs of the Russian Tsarists."
 BRG_Wo_alle_strasen_enden_desc:0 "The Tsar in Vyatka is ready. We have done all that we can to assist him in expanding his state and preparing for the next great Russian war. Unbeknownst to him, his realm would likely not exist in such a capable state without our assistance, and even the men closest to him, responsible for his own safety, are in our pockets. All of the pieces are set right for Vyatka to purge West Russia of the slime it is better off without, and to smite the enemies of the Schutzstaffel that persist in the Vaterland's eastern edge. The Tsar will have his empire returned to him, at our behest, and his mutual enemies with the Reichsführer-SS will meet their deserved fates: bathing in holy fire. If a few hundred thousand Slavs should have to die in rendering West Russia into an empire yet again, then it is all the better. The world could do with fewer of their kind anyway."

Such organizations, such as the widely-known "Ku Klux Klan," act as wild mongrels whereas the Burgundian stands as a strong wolf. However, these mongrels' direct stand against the "equality of races" forwarded by the American government, and, in turn, enemies of the democratic system, proving to be possible allies within the destabilization of the United States government. Thus, it is in our immediate interest within 세계계획 퓨마 to direct funding towards the support and expansion of such groups, as well as tying in various external agents to infiltrate the ranks and feed our influx of information from within the United States.

Thus, we shall begin drafting plans towards the fervent radicalization of these groups, and organize violent acts of unrest within these southern states.

That being, banks and the men that own them enjoy a wide range of freedoms in business practices, and enjoy laxing federal regulations thanks to the laziness of its statesmen. However, where these policies may be violations of the austerity of National Socialism, there remains a profitable venture for the Ordensstaat. Swaying the likenesses of bankers towards farther and farther right-winged interests will allow investments from the Ordensstaat to flourish, bolstering our economy while eroding the power of the federal government of the United States from containing its own economy, eventually leading to economic turmoil and fallout for them while we sit on our earned riches."

The letter was a great example of the most common piece of writing sent to RFK: A man from Georgia explains in a five page long essay that the "...institution of segregation will remain eternal in the American Deep South." The audacity and stunning conviction of that made Andre think that no possible letter could be worth sending to the President. Moments after picking up another letter, he changed his mind. A letter from a young girl attending Harvard, RFK's alamater, expressing her positive opinions on his policies regarding civil rights.\n\nAfter a couple of days, the President opened up the new re-packaged letter, to read about a young girl's message to the President.

The closest thing to it, however, would have to be the Reichsführer-SS's birthday.\n\nThe streets are lined with cheering civilians, almost entirely German settlers interspersed with the occasional French or Belgian collaborator. The avenues are filled with SS men, proud and strong, the true cream of the crop of the Aryan race. They carry high banners emblazoned with swastikas and Nordic runes, their torches burning bright despite the light of the day. A brass band plays "SS Marschiert in Feindesland," the de facto anthem of the Ordensstaat, and the men march in perfect unison to the beat of the drums.\n\nThe sound of celebration drifts over the river, much to the annoyance of the French puppet state's leaders, and much to the delight of the Reichsführer-SS. Although he is content with the scale of today's celebrations, he hopes that soon, the sounds will be coming from both sides of the Seine."

Let alone surrounded by two dozen other shady men making deals of their own. It was unnerving, to say the least.\n\nThe man in the grey hat extinguished his cigarette, glancing around furtively as he dropped the butt on the ground. "Do you have it?"\n\nThe man in the brown coat nodded, pulling out a thin package wrapped in brown paper and twine. "I expect the rest of your payment next Sunday."\n\nAs he handed it off, the door suddenly burst open. Men in black uniforms and grey stahlhelms flooded into the building, submachine guns aimed at the crowd before them. Many of the men in the building dropped to their knees, hands behind their heads in grim silence. A couple others frantically swallowed pills or the barrels of their pistols, preferring a swift end to whatever would await them in the camps. A couple tried to return fire, only to swiftly be cut down by the soldiers.\n\nEighteen men were taken into custody for subversive activities, with five dead; three by suicide and two while resisting arrest. A successful raid for the SS, all in all. The soldiers smiled as the men were loaded into the black vans, taking pride in having made the streets a bit cleaner."

Usual backchannel communications were utterly silent. People began to suspect the worst, until a Sicherheitsdienst spy was able to smuggle out a report: Josias had, in a fit of rage, abandoned the Reichsführer-SS. Apparently, he organized a lavish parade for an anticipated state visit from the Reichsführer-SS, but neglected to confirm whether his guest of honor could actually attend. Bizarrely believing this to be a betrayal, Josias then gave a speech denouncing the Ordensstaat as callous monsters and began purging the Kaukasische-SS of all men not loyal to himself.\n\nIt will take some time for the Sicherheitsdienst to rebuild their spy network and organize a retaliation, but the concerns of the budget are more pressing. Josias's slush fund was a valuable boon to the Ordensstaat's coffers, and its absence will be painfully felt in the bureaucracy.

He had spent twenty years in the city, first as head of the German military occupation, then in a nebulously-defined "advisory position" for the collaborator government. Either way, his job had remained the same: keep the Teutonic boot pressed on the Gallic neck. It was a job that he had performed admirably, but it gnawed away at him over the decades. The orders he signed, the reprisal killings against Resistance members' hometowns, the cattle-cars full of people who would never return... there was much that he was willing to stomach for the sake of his Vaterland, but sometimes it crossed the line.\n\nBut there were other aspects of his duty that he carried out with pride. When the regime was reorganized and Himmler was appointed as his superior, Carl-Heinrich tried his damndest to keep the SS on a short leash. But over the past several years, everyone he trusted in the administration was demoted, arrested on suspicious charges, or suffered a tragic accident. His power in the Parisian bureaucracy waned, and he became little more than an informant, passing along Himmler's latest doings to Germania. Now, he could no longer do even that. Truth be told, he should have been feeling relief that this onerous burden was no longer on his shoulders.\n\nBut all he felt was terror at the thought of who would replace him."

And its topics were equally varied, covering sociology, economics, education, military training, architecture, and everything he considered important to founding a new society. This was not just a projection, it was a manifesto, a blueprint for the construction of the ideal Aryan state.\n\nThe other men began trickling into the conference room, all of them wearing identical black Party uniforms with peaked officers' caps. They arrived at their chairs, threw out a crisp salute, then waited silently for a signal to sit down. When they all had arrived, the Reichsführer-SS gave a single salute in reply and pulled back his chair, prompting everyone else in the room to sit in near-perfect synchronization. They grabbed the folders in front of them, silently noting the words "A New Volksgemeinschaft" on the cover.

They were monotonous, packed closely together, and seemed to leech the color and liveliness from everything that could see them. However, if anyone felt unpleasant with them, they were smart enough not to vocalize those opinions. After all, were these styles not made with the consent of the Reichsführer-SS himself?

Its structure is ingeniously designed to root out subversives: a potential recruit is identified and approached by a Gestapo agent posing as a Brotherhood recruiter. They are brought to several meetings, and asked to do minor tasks to prove their loyalty: for example, stealing a crate of rifles from an (already-alterted) garrison. With their loyalty proven, they are asked to bring one or two trusted accomplices with them to the next meeting. There, they are all arrested and processed by the Gestapo.\n\nThe most challenging part of this plan will be building the reputation of this false organization. Underplay it in the media, and people will not hear of it; overplay it, and people will doubt the Ordensstaat's power.

American cigarettes, Italian wines, and Brazilian bananas seem to be their most popular brands. A few summary public executions of smugglers and purchasers, combined with a more aggressive beach-combing operation along the shoreline to find light boats with contraband, should be enough to deal with the problem in the meantime.\n\nAs for the Dutch, it seems that most of their involvement is radical pan-nationalists seeking to incite dissent among the Flemish communities of the Ordensstaat.

There were caches of concrete barriers, sandbags, caltrops, dragon's teeth, and even a couple artillery pieces—enough to stop anything up to and including a panzer. The garrison was now large enough to house dozens of soldiers, who could hold the fort against a far larger force for days on end until reinforced by an army coming from the interior. It was everything the Reichsführer-SS could hope for in a fortress.\n\n"What are you calling this model?" he asked one of the architects.\n\n"Project Ägis, Reichsführer-SS."\n\n"After the shield of the gods... the design is approved.

The more high-status ones managed to bluff their way in or secure an official authorization. Others deserted their posts or smuggled themselves in. One particularly resourceful Obersturmführer stationed in Cornwall stole a local's sailboat and went right across the Channel under the cover of night, sailing into Kalen the next morning. Some have had to leave their families behind, of course, but we all must make sacrifices for the Vaterland.\n\nA reason for the men's recall has not been issued, though rumors swirl among the rank-and-file about the Reichsführer-SS's motivations. The most popular one, spoken only in hushed tones when officers are out of the room, is that war is imminent in the Reich.

As my colleague mentioned earlier, while creating atomic-proof facilities for an estimated four hundred thousand people is a challenge, it is within the parameters faced by Organisation Todt during the War, and with enough funding doable within a four to six year period. Now, the rail network for Project Lifthrasir is a whole other matter. Even with the hundred and sixty thousand subjects that are in the process of being resettled in the Alpine region, that leaves us two hundred and forty thousand subjects, eighty thousand of whom are considered critical, primarily located in the Paris, Aurelstadt and Elsass regions. My proposal is as follows. Three four-lane subterranean rail lines encased in reinforced concrete at a depth of 11 meters.

Normal construction work and operation in our factories can resume and our missing smallarms and gear have been returned."\n\nThe room erupted in applause from the assembled SS officers, the usual self-congratulatory nonsense Joachim Peiper loathed. He was the only one present not applauding, so after a pause to consider whether he should, he clapped his hands three times, slowly. The room went silent as everyone turned to him.\n\n"Impressively efficient indeed, Oberführer Eriksson, but you forgot something. These... bandits you were pursuing, they were also thieves, no? So where is what they stole? The Reichsführer will want to know."\n\nEriksson gave a sly grin. "I assure you, Langemarck is hot on the tail of the stolen... items. The Reichsführer will indeed know very well the location viability of any recovered fuel and computer parts once they have been safely brought to their rightful destination."\n\nSomething about Eriksson's statement and unusual bluster seriously unnerved Peiper, and while he smiled and nodded for the Oberführer to continue, he made a silent mental note to conduct his own little private investigation."

"They are silos, Sir. To house atomic-tipped missiles with intercontinental range. Truly the future."\n\n"The future indeed, Josephe. If these are to house the missiles of our friends in Paris, I assume there is a reason the Chef Domaine have not given us even the slightest of word of the missiles nor these wondrous atomic devices yet despite most of the holes being dug months ago?"\n\n"I had a talk with our contacts in Paris and Bruxelles about just that; I did wonder just the same, Sir. Turns out the Bâtard Flamand has been kicking up a fuss about just the same issue, he may be having a bit of a scuffle with the Chef Domaine."\n\n"Good, then I want our boys to have just as many concessions as the Bâtard, Eriksson is not going to be the Chef's little pet again.

The calls have made clear that Charlemagne and its divisional head, Brigadeführer de la Mazière will take it as a direct insult if they are not trusted with the handling of nuclear materials. While obviously it would be a minimal risk for us to entrust Charlemagne with this, given their great loyalty to our cause, giving concessions to them risks inflaming tensions with Langemarck. Still, given Charlemagne's considerable position of power within the SS, and to ensure the increasingly paranoid de la Maziére that we have no desire to challenge his position of authority, it seems clear we must do our best to appease them.

Gone was the triumphant attitude the roughly two hundred men and half a dozen women had felt only minutes before when they marched into the courtyard of the Alsatian castle Heinrich Himmler called his home, their leader proudly announcing the final verdict regarding the recent nuclear test as a resounding success when he presented his report. A creeping dread filled the crowd as the Reichsführer, instead of congratulating them, had merely signalled to some soldiers for a table, chair and pencil to be brought him. For the past quarter hour, he had been sitting quietly, flipping through pages, letting his fingers slide across photos of the mushroom cloud and damage to the test site, and chewing on his pencil, occasionally tapping it on a photo or underlining a word or phrase in the text.\n\nAfter another half hour of nervous staring from the assembled scientists, Himmler finished the last page and closed the folder, handing it and the pencil to a soldier who stepped up. Getting up to leave, the Reichsführer turned to the lead scientist. Himmler's face seemed disaffected, nearly bored, but those standing closest could see an ember of triumph in his eyes behind the reading glasses he had put on.\n\n"Good. Proceed with Phase Two."\n\n"Jawohl mein Reichsführer! Heil Himmler!"\n\nThe Reichsführer paid no heed to the lead researcher's statement, and showed no sign of hearing the collective "HEIL HIMMLER!" of the assembled crowd which followed their leader's salute. Even so, arms remained outstretched for almost a full minute after the doors to the inner castle shut with a clank in front of them."

 BRG_kondor.1.desc:0 "Iberia is a bastard state.  This is certainly true of its most recent incarnation, as a patchwork of two governments united only by the desire to hold off the influence of the Reich.  But it has been this way for a very long time.  The peninsula has never known Aryan rule, having been settled by lesser peoples of southern Europe.  Greeks, Phoenicians, Lusitanians, and more.  All of these peoples became a stew of new languages and nations, from the savage Moors to the bizarre Basques.  And this is to say nothing of their centuries of vile Jewish influence.  Altogether, Iberia is a patchwork of inferior peoples that should never have become one unified power.  But this is also an opportunity for us.  Many of these peoples-Basque, Catalan, Asturian, Galician-seek independence from the central government.  Moreover, the Iberian state occupies a unique position on the world stage.  Its economy has been wrecked by the Gibraltar Dam, but it also finds itself in control of the thing.  It has a sizable overseas colonial empire.  In short, there is a great deal of room to further our ambitions through the strange, impure amalgamation that is the Iberian Union."

Its location at the gate to the Mediterranean and the European continent makes the prize of a friendly Iberian polity too valuable for the great powers to resist interfering in the conflict, and tensions are sure to escalate across the globe as they find themselves backing rival factions.\n\nThere is much work to be done. Plans must be adapted, and new ones made. Assets must be activated and put to work. These first, chaotic months will define a conflict that might last years, and these crucial moments will contain the best chances to make the wars serve our purposes.

The Portuguese loathe the Spanish, and the Castillian Spanish loathe the Portuguese almost as much as they loathe the various minorities in their nation, who loathe them back. It seems the only ones the whole peninsula can agree to loathe are the natives in their colonies and the concept of competent government. Without the strong state seen in our Ordenstaat, Iberia fumbles in the dark, always at the brink of immeasurable violence.\n\nLike a house of cards, all we need is one little push on the right card, and it will all come crumbling down.

It is hard to stop them from being distracted by petty internal squabbles, and many of the more left wing movements begin growing increasingly skeptical to our arms shipments as they start to suspect their origins. Not every faction can be as willingly subverted as our friends the Asturians, but that can easily be remedied using our strategically placed insiders. False information about another political faction making it seem the weapons come from us here, a bit of propaganda there, and maybe some slight application of bribery, blackmail and political smearing where necessary. \n\nIf we can continue to successfully wrangle the separatists using our insiders, it may be time to begin considering withdrawing some of our German agents from Iberia, to lessen the risk of detection."

While he may be an economist by trade, Salazar is an imperialist conservative at heart.  He dabbles in strange ideas, like Portuguese pluricontinentalism, that would see the Union retain and expand its influence in Africa, and perhaps even beyond.  With Salazar holding the reins of power, Iberia would stagnate, more obsessed with retaining old glories than building a state for the modern world.  More importantly, it would be a state that crosses lines in order to achieve dominance over new parts of the globe.  In Algeria, especially, Salazar's Iberia would push its luck, perhaps too far.

The Ordenstaat will supply these groups with all the guns they could ever need.  In return, the profits from this arms smuggling will bring liquid capital back to the Ordenstaat.

It is understated to say that every moment the world continues to tolerate their existence is an affront to civilization and to humanity.\n\nSecondarily, it is incumbent upon us to select among the other warlords one who is most useful to us as a counterweight in the east against our rivals, and to do what we can to either turn the others to his side or else see to their collective ruin. One candidate looks particularly promising, and has even rendered aid upon our Führer once before: the warlord of Vyatka, a man who would style himself an emperor, and would surely not rebuff our assistance in reclaiming his birthright. Others look useful for entirely pragmatic reasons; Komi is perhaps the most easily manipulated of them all, so fragile a democracy that even the slightest push could be enough to turn their resources to our favour. We will court both of them to the unwitting service of the Reichsführer-SS."

The attackers assumedly made off with whatever they could take with them and blew up the rest, leaving no hint as to their origins. War material is hard to come by in West Russia, and this attack will significantly hamper both our weapons stockpiles and our logistical capabilities going into the near future. Our men will have to be wary of future such incursions, in case this is a prelude to a more serious invasion—it would also be wise to reprise against whichever of our neighbours we think is responsible."

The famines and unrest afflicting the rest of Russia must be severe for the powers that be in such lands to be turning away strong fighting men such as these.

 BRG.5003.d:0 "Everyone here knew him as 'Simeon'. He tried not to give out a surname, but if anyone persisted, he would tell them it was Verenich. Neither name meant anything to him. Someone back in Paris had picked them for him, just like they had picked his background. He was a river merchant, from a farm village outside Murygino. He had three children: two daughters living with his wife, and a son that died in the war. Which war he died in, and fighting which enemy, depended on who he was speaking to at the time. His identity was eminently plausible, both common and dreary enough to not inspire much questioning. He'd never gotten accustomed to living as 'Simeon', though. Russia was too hostile and alien for him to ever feel at ease here. He mostly stayed by himself ever since arriving, and every time he had to talk to someone—like today—all he had on his mind was the need not to give himself away.\n\nConstruction was underway in Vyatka. An impressive looking port facility was being built along the river, at the behest of the local Tsar. Rumour abound of a plan by the Tsar to earn himself a war chest manufacturing vodka, and it was just that sort of rumour that 'Simeon' was eager to exploit. A medium sized bribe was enough for him to be sat in an office opposite the Crown Representative to the port, discussing a trade agreement Simeon was sure would be too enticing for the bureaucrat to resist. His ships would sail into Vyatka to unload potatoes collected from farm towns connected to the river, and on their way out of the city again, those same crates would be filled with bottles of the Tsar's vodka. Of course, the potato crates would hide secret compartments hiding bullets and disassembled rifles, and many of Simeon's crew were secretly more SS agents. The port bureaucrat didn't need to know that, though. All he needed to see was a friendly smile from a local merchant, eager to make a profit for himself and his Tsar."

They lied through their teeth to the authorities, insisting to be imperial loyalists coming to Vyatka to pledge their service to the Tsar. Every one of them felt sick having to impersonate a Slav, and a few barely even tried, staring at onlookers with a hostile glare that only made the whole group look even more intimidating. They each had their own tale to spin about why and how they arrived here, some talking of famine and others explaining away their peculiar manner of speaking with stories about their far away origins. Maybe some of the locals raised an eyebrow or two, but the Tsar's officials were all too eager to unwittingly accept the undercover SS veterans into their ranks, blue eyes or not."

 BRG.5005.d:0 "In the Russian warlord state of Komi, where once there stood just another derelict old building reminding Russians of the old days, there was now a fully functioning propaganda factory, helping to usher Russia into a new age. A handful of SS agents, stocked with exotic supplies hard to find in the wastes of Russia (such as paper and paint), had been enough to repair and renovate the building into what would pass in Russia for an office complex. From there, they produced an extremely efficient printing and inking complex, producing hundreds of propaganda posters a day advertising the campaigns of extremist political parties in the so-called 'Komi Republic'. Decrying the dangers of imminent onslaught from the likes of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the posters depict a Komi Republic on the precipice of destruction, the Red Army about to arrive and crush all of the republic's citizens beneath its boot. Those same citizens have seemed receptive to the efforts of our agents thus far; there has been a noticeable uptick in support for nationalist and fascist parties in this most fragile of republics. It likely won't be long now before Komi's little experiment with democracy comes crashing to an abrupt end."

An extremely vocal far-right minority has made its presence known, very loudly and very suddenly, and their agitation has been turning more and more of Komi's citizens towards the farthest rightist parties. Decrying each of our neighbours in West Russia, the agitators and their propaganda insist that an invasion from one or another rival state is on its way, and that our republic needs radical, immediate change to its military and domestic policies if we are to survive it—including the end of our democratic traditions. Where exactly the material for these posters came from, or who has been covering our streets with them, remains a mystery, but authorities have been monitoring the usual suspects.

Every night, weapons are stolen and captives are freed, and each day another revolt from the subdued denizens of the Brotherhood needs to be put down. These constant thefts and minor rebellions are peppered with more infrequent major acts of sabotage. Explosives going off in ammunition depots, or entire platoons deserting their posts, have become far too common for the manpower and equipment reserves of the Brotherhood to keep up. Something will have to change, and soon, or the Brotherhood may be at risk of collapse."

Beginning with his defeat against and subsequent defection to the war machine of the Reich, he has had little success in realizing his grandiose plans to reunite Russia and earn for himself a title in Russian history books greater than that of 'traitor'. A traitor, though, is all that he deserves to be remembered for, a traitor—and a Slav besides—can never be considered truly loyal to the Aryan race. Thus, the agents of the Ordenstaat emplaced in Vlasov's Samaran rump-state will see to it that he never amounts to anything else but his great betrayal.\n\nOne of Vlasov's underlings, Oktan, has wavered in his loyalties to the traitor warlord ever since the end of the West Russian War. Oktan rightfully views Vlasov as a submissive underling to the Reich, a man who betrayed his own people to serve a foreign power, and is justly hated for it by all men from Samara to Arkhangelsk. Oktan has his own ambitions, and leads a troupe of Vlasov's high ranking subordinates who wish to see the traitor warlord replaced. They have their own silly beliefs about what will happen afterwards, imagining that Oktan can lead Russia to find greatness, but their sad delusions are not of any concern to us. All that matters to the Reichsführer-SS is seeing Vlasov's head on a pike, and Oktan can deliver that. Our agents will tell those of Vlasov's generals who have not yet pledged themselves to Oktan to join with him, extolling his virtues as the only commander brave, ambitious and strong enough to save Russia. All lies, of course."

The great showdown between communist and anti-communist forces in the region is about to kick off, and it is clear which side's victory would most benefit the designs of the Reichsführer-SS. Our agents adjunct to Russia have been acting in the shadows for months and years, subtly turning the nationalist Russian state into something more than just another warlord: something that can fight against the festering corpse of the Soviet Union in Arkhangelsk, and win. Our primary contact in Vyatka, the river merchant responsible for positioning so many of our men in the Okhrana, will receive word of a large new shipment coming in soon. A cache of upgraded weapons is not all that awaits him; we will also be transferring all of our field agents in Russia to Vyatka, to directly assist in the impending war, personally. The collared bear will maul the communist menace to death for us, and feast on its corpse to become a power to rival the corruption that pollutes the Reich. Not only will Russia be purged of Judeo-Bolshevik influences, but it will also stand strong enough to take its place in our great plans for the future. The SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is about to witness a great personal victory, and shall not have had to move much more than a finger to see it done. "

Most all of those Russians who rightly abhor the socialist menace that once destroyed our empire have come over to our side, and even the civilians of the conquered territories are enthusiastic to see their Tsar emerge victorious over the WRRF. Support for conservative, pro-war parties and organizations across Vyatka and beyond is on the rise as citizens take to the streets to demonstrate in support of our regim, and our stockpiles of manpower are being helped along by this outpouring of support too, recruiters reporting a sharp uptick in recruitment into the Imperial Army. With peace and stability at home and more men ready to fight and die for the Tsar than we ever before, we have never been more ready for a showdown against the revolutionary menace than we are today."

BRG.5014.d:0 "There was a stillness on the river Ob that night. A sense of emptiness, a hunger. It was as if every plant and animal was holding their breath. There was no moon in the sky. The stars were concealed behind clouds. There was only blackness. Gaping, yawning, waiting. \n\nAnd then, just past midnight, a man stepped into the clearing. He looked up at the empty sky, down at the cold dark water, and then intently at the path from which he had come. He too was silent. He too was waiting. \n\nNot much later, a second man arrived. The two men glanced at each other, and without speaking drew small coins from hidden pockets. Twin runes were set on the silver, barely visible amidst the darkness. \n\nThe first man was a river-trader, a well known pillar of the community in Vyatka. He was known to give alms to the beggars and candy to the children. The second was a printer from Komi. He was a recluse, but would sometimes come to gatherings. When he did, it was a cause for great celebration, as he told stories of enemies near and far, battles one and battles lost, of heroism and tragedy. \n\nThey were agents of the SD division of the SS-Burgundy. They had one purpose: to unleash chaos and cruelty among the Russian lands, and so further the higher purposes of the Reichsfurher-SS.\n\nThe Agents spoke quietly, quickly, and with as few words as possible. Their work in the west was done, it was time to bring the rightful punishment of the Untermensch to Siberia, and move Operation Bar one step closer to completion."

More often than not the refugees had brought large families that preferred safety in numbers, and the city had lost many of its residents in the wars and raids. The residents of the "Vienna of the Urals" had grown used to the derelict buildings, and were thus rather surprised when overnight one of the hovels transformed into a thriving business. \n\nA new printmaker had arrived, moved in from Komi. He was a genial fellow, who preferred to speak as little as possible of his business and much more about the hectic politics of the Russian wastes. It was unclear who exactly used his business, but they surely seemed to be generous as the presses were turning day and night. In time, the townsfolk grew used to their new neighbor, and ceased to wonder about such things. After all, they were just suddenly realizing the grave danger their precious city state was in, as the great warlords to the east and west alike hovered predatorily overhead. The other nearby principalities were experiencing a similar burst of suspicion and fear, and old wounds and grievances between the Ural states soon resurfaced. \n\nEach passing day seemed to bring another wild rumor of the cruelties and madness of enemies near and far, spurred on, just maybe, by the extraordinarily well-designed fear-mongering posters that had sprouted on every corner. Meanwhile, the printshop stayed lit and humming well into the night, as Orenburg's newest citizen told his stories and performed his dark work."

The guards were thrown forward, and though they survived with only minor injuries, they could only watch helplessly as a great portion of our arms stockpile went up in smoke.

When he saw the figure emerge out of the dark, he however lowered his weapon. "Werner? You mad bastard, I almost shot you! What are you doing in Vyatka? I've never seen you east of Kostroma!"\n\nThe pale, skeletally thin Volga German held up a cigarette, and Werner lit it with his cigar. "You are one to speak about where I should and should not appear, Mikhail. You know as well as I do that we rarely had to meet because of our man in Komi. Without him, I sometimes have to make these trips myself, as do you."\n\nHe took a deep inhale of the cigarette. "But enough about old times. I see you have made quite the name for yourself, you are trading all over West Russia now.

What idiots these Slavs were, no surprise the Old Führer had declared they should be scoured from the Earth with the other unworthy.\n\nHaving stuffed his suitcase with the Russian's collection of Reichsmarks, Werner hurried to the docks. All around him the city was abuzz with war preparations, he saw marching columns, propaganda posters and worried citizens discussing a return to rationing. The time was almost nigh, and Werner smiled.\n\nAs he entered the riverboat headed down the Volga-Kama network once plowed by Werner's smugglers, he noted the crew. Six of them, four passengers. One weapon, a rifle. Captain probably had a pistol too. Pathetic. Back in the day no riverboat would travel without an armed contingent. Sign of New Russia indeed. Oh well, should be a simple enough business taking them down once they approached Moskowien. It was time to go "home," finally see that supposed paradise his fellow SS men and the Reichsführer had created in Burgund.

"Dedicated and disciplined, curious, yet intriguing." the Führer pondered, as he approached the Commanding Officer of the Freikorps units. "Oberstleutnant Käufer, I have been told? You and your men shall be greatly rewarded for your service towards the true patriots of the German Reich and the rightful heir to become the Führer. I must ask, of course: where is it that you and your men hail from?" \n\nA tense moment of silence adorned the conversation beyond the smiles, as the Oberstleutnant's bright eyes locked with Göring's pale, steely eyes. "Stuttgart, my Führer." the Commanding Officer stated as he offered the Führer a salute. As Göring addressed the Stuttgarter, he could not help but question the intentions and information given by this Oberstleutnant Käufer. However, as Käufer and his men walked away, Göring acknowledged that these men would fight for him, and that's all he needed."

BRG_a_wise_leader_desc:0 "정적들은 SS국가지도자를 "제복 입은 미친놈"으로 치부하고 있습니다. 사실은 그는 독일에서 마지막으로 제정신인 사람입니다. 자기들의 지도자가 국가사회주의를 버렸고, 그 명분을 떠맡을 만한 다른 사람이 없다는 것을 국민들이 어떻게 깨닫지 못할 수 있겠습니까?\n\n다행히도 SS국가지도자는 게르마니아가 불타는 동안 허송세월을 보내지 않았습니다. 모든 것이 잘 되어 유럽에서 질서가 회복되는 때가 곧 올 것입니다."
BRG_a_loyal_army_desc:0 "히틀러가 기사단국 건국에서 행한 첫 번째 실수는 SS국가지도자가 원하는 만큼 추종자를 부르도록 허용한 것이었습니다. 총통의 귀를 들어먹고 있는 썩어빠진 놈들에게 이것은 완벽한 생각처럼 보였습니다. 소위 광신자들은 더 이상 집 앞을 지나며 행진하지도 않고, 지키지도 못한 가치를 상기시키며, 그들 자신을 위해 건설한 퇴폐적인 낙원을 없애겠다고 위협했습니다.\n\n그러나 그것이 새로생긴 기사단국에 호재에 불과하다는 것이 밝혀졌습니다. 한때 충섬심이 의심되는 프랑스 "협력자"로 가득 찬 관료집단과 헌병대는 경험 많고, 능률적이며, 무엇보다도 헌신적인 군대로 대체되었습니다. 그들은 국가를 운영하고, 빨치산을 처단하고, 가장 가혹한 조건에서 싸우는 법을 압니다. 그리고 그들이 다시 싸우는 날이 곧 올지도 모릅니다."

BRG_unlock.1.desc:0 "The Reich has, for decades, stood tall and proud over Europe, maintaining a strong pillar of order and security throughout the continent. And, most importantly to the Reich, they maintained the interests of the decadent fat cats in Germania who had corrupted the administration of the Führer. Even the Reichsführer-SS, entrusted with the administration of the Ordenstaat, found himself chained and restricted from carrying out the Aryan will by those who would corrupt the National Socialist ideal.\n\nYet now those decadent degenerates who played in the shadows of Germania begin to emerge into the light in an attempt to strike one another down. As a result, Germany stumbles and falters, as Aryan sons are convinced against one another, called upon to serve for the causes of decrepit old men. However, with the rapid decay in Germany comes a silver lining. The strong pillar that is the Reich has begun to crumble, and the chains that have attached Europe to it begin to grow loose. Plots and plans that were once naught but a pipe dream might soon enter the realm of possibility.\n\nOur dreams must be realized. France, or rather, the rump state still known as France, must be brought to heel once again so that the Ordenstaat may prosper and work towards the Reichsführer-SS's plan. Yet, before we march to expand the confines of the Ordenstaat, we must first ensure that our loyal local collaborators are as loyal as they seem..."

In front of him laid the intelligence file regarding Léon Degrelle. Léon Degrelle, the former leader of the Belgian region of the Ordenstaat. Léon Degrelle, the Traitor of Traitors who led devilish revolutionaries to wage open war against his Aryan masters. Léon Degrelle, found dead at the end of the great search for him. Though the path Degrelle led appeared miserable, it gave the Reichsführer-SS a chilling thought regarding more threats to the Plan. \n\nHow on Earth did he expect to bring about the Vision into the world if he did not have the rest of these potential and former rebels succumbing to his rule, like a ragged, starved hound to the man holding the steak? Allowing the French, Walloonian, or the Belgian to remain stewing in the scorn of defeat as they are treated as such will inevitably see them revolt; however, if we just so happen to placate them for long enough, perhaps it would give the Reichsführer-SS and the ORdenstaat enough time to bring about the Plan into the world, and see the necessity of such pacifistic awakenings of our will gone from this Earth?"

The treacherous legions of Charlemagne and Walloonian may have worked for the Reichsführer-SS when it so suited them, but their minds have always been blackened with hidden thoughts of treason and treachery. Such hidden plots and aspirations shall never come to pass.\n\nThe Ordenstaat has outgrown the need to appease such collaborators. They will be dismantled. Their assets will be seized. What resources they have had at their disposal shall be brought back into the fold.

Once again, France was swift to fall to German hands, surrendering vast tracts of their already pathetic nation to the Ordenstaat.\n\nDespite the weakness of the French nation, the land they occupied is rich. Fertile, well populated, and well stocked with natural resources, the French have for millenia put the potential of their soil to waste. The Aryan man, however, is not so decadent. It will be no small effort, but we shall achieve greatness upon the very grounds upon which the French failed.\n\nIt all begins with the existing industry and workforce. Those assets which were damaged in the short war must be repaired, and the formerly French industries and workforce must be integrated into Burgundian society for the betterment of the Aryan race.

The Middle East, the global oil well, has grown unstable. Production in the region has ground to a near halt, and as a result the nations of the world have scrambled elsewhere for their precious crude.\n\nAs regions previously unsuited to provide for much more than local needs are hurriedly prospected for international exports, the impending shortages are easily predictable. Yet, the Ordenstaat cannot afford such a shortage. Should the global oil situation grow any more perilous, we run the possibility of being cut off entirely from the oil tap. This cannot come to pass. We must act immediately to obtain for ourselves a novel source of oil that we may rely upon to power the engines of the Ordenstaat soon, else we may find ourselves joining the world in crisis."

As of current, it would take but one determined leader who cares not for the deaths of a hundred thousand civilians to commit his forces against the Ordenstaat, and from which point we would find ourselves helpless and possibly defeated.\n\nThe arsenal must grow, at all costs.

The usual rate of re-education and germanization efforts, however, will not suffice in this case.\n\nWhilst we may rely in part upon the SS-Charlemagne collaborators, and whilst they may utter pledges of loyalty to the Reichsführer-SS upon a regular basis, they may not be ignored for what they are: French nationalists, who surely long for the day where their strength is great enough to topple the Ordenstaat to which they are made to bend the knee. And this novel base of Frenchmen is surely a tantalizing opportunity for them.\n\nThis opportunity for treason will be disintegrated in front of them. No more shall the instability wrought by Charlemagne grow. All efforts of re-education and germanization shall be redoubled, until all living in the French territories are brought under the Germanic wing. The stability of the Ordenstaat relies upon it."

As other nations falter and struggle, their industries continuing to ebb and flow, the industries of the Ordenstaat have only continued to provide increasing production metrics, month in and month out. Yet it would appear that such success has not been without a cost.\n\nFarmers were made to leave the fields. The plow was traded for the wrench, as a record number of men laboured in the foundries and factories across our domain. However, the silos would quietly begin to store less grain, for there was less grain to store. Yet we did not falter in our efforts, for the world is full of grain. Now and again the silos would once again begin to grow empty, and once again the WVHA would simply secure further imports of grain from the Ukraine. Men could eat and return to their production lines day in and day out.\n\nBut the Ukrainian grain shipments have ceased. No longer do trains full of eastern grain top off our silos to feed the labouring men. Swiftly our silos begin to empty, and there is simply no way to fill them again unless serious domestic action is taken. For now the situation is not yet forlorn, but upon the horizon looms a hideous famine which looks to put the plans of the Reichsführer-SS at risk, and such cannot be allowed."

Our efforts ended when they should have, by all means, continued.\n\nAs a result, famine continues to ravage the Ordenstaat, and worse than before. Once again, we are bound to act radically, even more so than before, else risk facing a cataclysmic mass starvation which will see every facet of Burgundian society, from the top echelons to the most lowly undesirables, endure great suffering.\n\nNo stone may be left unturned.

While the pitiful excuse for a French Army was easily folding before the might of the Waffen-SS, it was no thanks to the Walloon Legion. In fact, according to other SS division headquarters, they were hardly advancing at all and refusing to report their positions to others. This was borderline treason! Schlosser picked up his phone, dialing Léon Degrelle's number. The Walloon Legion's leader didn't pick up, but one of his German attaches did. "Put me through to Degrelle!" Schlosser barked.\n\n"Standartenführer Degrelle is gone, sir."\n\n"Then find him and put him on!"\n\n"You do not understand, sir. Degrelle is GONE."\n\nThe next few hours were consumed by an onslaught of panicked phone calls, briefings to a confused high command, and a mad scramble to find a replacement commander for the Legion. The well-respected Walloon officer Jean-François Thiriart received a battlefield promotion, and he was able to execute the assigned maneuvers after a short delay. Although the immediate crisis has been solved, Degrelle has practically vanished off the face of the Earth, and many of his immediate subordinates in the Legion are unable (or unwilling) to say where he went. The SS is going to get to the bottom of this, one way or another."

The officers of the Reichsführer-SS's personal staff stared expressionless as the newly-minted Standartenführer Jean-François Thiriart rattled off lists of supplies the Walloon Legion requested, as well as the inane tasks they'd waste them on.\n\n"...and the organization of a manhunt against Léon Degrelle, traitor to the Ordensstaat." This got their attention. Thiriart slid over a typed list of supply requisitions, with the SS officers thumbed through. One departed into another room, carrying the list, and the muffled sounds of a phone conversation could be heard. When he returned, he was as stoic as ever, but with a hint of surprise in his eyes.\n\n"The Reichsführer-SS has personally approved your supply requisitions and applauds your eagerness to eliminate those who work to undermine National Socialism. He expects good results from you."\n\n"Yes, yes, of course! Thank you! Sieg heil!" Thiriart exclaimed as he gathered his belongings and hastily departed the conference room.

The results were unfortunately sparse, in no small part due to the (in)action of the Walloon Legion. Schlosser even included an addendum containing a veritable laundry list of all the ways Legion officers have hampered the investigation. Orders conveniently lost in the chain of command, low troop morale, contaminated evidence, weak alibis, missing witness reports, the list went on and on. This amount of incompetence was rapidly shifting into insubordination, if not an outright conspiracy within the Legion to stall the investigation.\n\nThankfully, their new leader Thiriart seemed to have his head on straight. He was loyal, determined, and above all else, always seeking his Reichsführer-SS's approval. He sent a telegram shortly after Schlosser's report arrived, asking for how he should approach the investigation. Although he mentions the Legion is capable of beginning the investigation at once, he also asks for the Reichsführer-SS's blessing to collaborate with the SS-Legion Langemarck; although the Flemish no doubt hate the Walloon Legion, they hate Degrelle more."

I'm not one of your gatlikker toadies."\n\n"It's not a what that's a problem, but a who," Thiriart whispered. "Degrelle."\n\nErikkson's interest was piqued. "So the rumors are true then.

Although the sight would be unusual in much of the Ordensstaat, one of the few autonomies the Walloon Legion retained was the right to police their own regional borders. While the leader of the Legion would ostensibly have no problem crossing, discontent was considerably higher in the ranks, especially after word got out that he was collaborating with the Flemish to search for their beloved former leader. Thankfully, soldiers in the convey had their doubts (and scruples about working with Langemark) thoroughly silenced with promotions and pay raises.\n\nThe Benz's rear window rolled down as a guard approached, revealing Thiriart and Erikkson sitting in the back. "Bonjour, soldier!" Thiriart beamed. "Official business on behalf of the Reichsführer-SS. Here are the papers, they should all be in order."\n\nThe guard took the papers and marched into the checkpoint's office. All around, it seemed that the guards were on edge, watching the convoy like hawks and fingers on the triggers of their rifles. Would they ever dare to open fire on their commanding officer? No, of course not. They wouldn't, right?\n\nAfter a tense minute, the guard exited and returned Thiriart's papers. "Everything seems to be in order, Standartenführer. Sieg heil," he hissed, before coldly saluting and marching back inside. The gate opened and the convoy pulled through unimpeded. As Erikkson waved at the Walloon guards with a shit-eating grin on his face, Thiriart pulled out his case notes and a map. Where to next?"

The initial pages were discouraging, full of euphemisms like "exhausted leads" and "temporary obstacles." But as the investigation was winding down, Thiriart and Erikkson's squad stumbled upon a bunker that was ostensibly decommissioned and removed from records years ago. More curiously, it was guarded by Walloon Legion soldiers who weren't part of any chain of command. They opened fire on sight, and Thiriart and his men were forced to fight a bloody room-to-room battle to clear the bunker.\n\nIn one of the rooms, they came across two rogue Legionnaires concluding the impromptu cremation of a body. They were quickly killed by the loyalists and the fire was doused; although the body had been severely burned by the fire, it could still be identified as a middle-aged man in an SS officer's uniform. An exit wound at the top of the skull indicated that he had shot himself shortly before his body was burnt, meaning he had likely committed suicide when the raid on the bunker began.\n\nThe Reichsführer-SS opened an envelope that accompanied the report, thumbing through grisly photos of the charred corpse. Nauseating as the scene was, it certainly looked enough like Degrelle. He queasily returned the pictures to their resting place, and let out a sigh of relief. Schlosser's report concluded by mentioning that since the news of the raid spread, there was significantly more quiet in the ranks of the Legion. It wasn't certain that Degrelle was dead, but in these trying times, it was good enough for now."

Why?"\n\n"Because according to his 1941 Wehrmacht examination records, he has fillings in both his second maxillary molars and no other work done."\n\nThe doctor with the caliper's eyes widened with realization. "Then does that mean-"\n\n"So it would seem."\n\n"I believe we should inform the Reichsführer-SS."\n\n"Most definitely. I'll find a phone.""

BRG_huntdegrelle.9.t:0 "A False Start"
BRG_huntdegrelle.9.desc:0 "The line of trucks headed by a black Benz sedan pulled to a stop at the fortified border checkpoint. Although the sight would be unusual in much of the Ordensstaat, one of the few autonomies the Walloon Legion retained was the right to police their own regional borders. While the leader of the Legion would ostensibly have no problem crossing, discontent was considerably higher in the ranks since the hunt for their beloved former leader began. Thankfully, soldiers in the convey had already been vetted and were equally devoted to the cause as Thiriart.\n\nThe Benz's rear window rolled down as a guard approached, revealing Thiriart and Erikkson sitting in the back. "Bonjour, soldier!" Thiriart beamed. "Official business on behalf of the Reichsführer-SS. Here are the papers, they should all be in order."\n\nThe guard took the papers and glanced at them with a disapproving sneer before shoving them back into Thiriart's hands. "Denied, per my Sturmbannführer's orders."\n\nThiriart's smile vanished. "No, soldier, I don't think you understand. I am  your Sturmbannführer's commanding officer, acting on behalf of the Reichsführer-SS. Now let me through, and we will forget about this. But if you don't, when word gets back to Ost-Paris, I-"\n\n"Heaven is high and Himmler is far away," the guard flatly responded before turning around and marching back into the checkpoint's office. The disloyal Legionnaires raised their guns, all targeted squarely at Thiriart's car. The message was clear, so the convoy reluctantly reversed.\n\nThiriart was not bluffing when he said Ost-Paris would hear. His report reached the Reichsführer-SS's desk, and he eagerly awaits his leader's word on how to deal with these insubordinate elements."

BRG_huntdegrelle.10.t:0 "No Quarter"
BRG_huntdegrelle.10.desc:0 "When Thiriart returned to the Walloon border checkpoint, he was ready. He didn't ride in the backseat of a Benz, but an armored car, and he was preceded by three dozen of the Legion's finest and a barrage of mortar fire. IT was a level of firepower that the traitorous Legionnaires were not expecting, but as a testament to their training, they stood firm and returned fire.\n\nThe fighting soon settled into an uneasy stalemate, with the soldiers at the checkpoint unable to repel Thiriart, and Thiriart unable to storm the checkpoint without charging across the open road. But as the day dragged on and the fear of the other side receiving reinforcements grew, desperation forced their hands. The traitors attempted to advance from their positions, but they overplayed their hand; Thiriart, sensing an opportunity, ordered his men to charge. His timing was able to lessen the potential amount of casualties, but a good amount of Thiriart's force was killed during the charge and the ensuing room-to-room fighting in the checkpoint's offices.\n\nAs the evening began, the treasonous Sturmbannführer and the rest of his command staff were dead, with those few who surrendered being executed by Thiriart personally. A couple of the surviving traitors who professed ignorance as to who was shooting at them were merely stripped of their weapons and kept under close watch. With these distractions finally removed, the hunt for Degrelle could begin in earnest."

BRG_huntdegrelle.11.t:0 "A Traitor's End?"
BRG_huntdegrelle.11.desc:0 "Schlosser's much-anticipated report on the hunt for Degrelle arrived on the Reichsführer-SS's desk, which he eagerly flipped through. Despite some initial setbacks, Thiriart and his squadron inspected a bunker that was ostensibly decommissioned and removed from records years ago. However, it was guarded by Walloon Legion soldiers who weren't part of any chain of command. The guards were taken by surprise, and the ensuing firefight was rather quick and had few loyalist casualties.\n\nIn one of the bunker's rooms, they came across two rogue Legionnaires concluding the impromptu cremation of a body. They were quickly killed by the loyalists and the fire was doused; although the body had been severely burned by the fire, it could still be identified as a middle-aged man in an SS officer's uniform. An exit wound at the top of the skull indicated that he had shot himself shortly before his body was burnt, meaning he had likely committed suicide within a day of the bunker raid.\n\nThe Reichsführer-SS opened an envelope that accompanied the report, thumbing through grisly photos of the charred corpse. Nauseating as the scene was, it certainly looked enough like Degrelle. He queasily returned the pictures to their resting place, and let out a sigh of relief. Schlosser's report concluded by mentioning that since the news of the raid spread, there was significantly more quiet in the ranks of the Legion. It wasn't certain that Degrelle was dead, but in these trying times, it was good enough for now."

BRG_huntdegrelle.12.desc:0 "The convoy headed by the black Benz pulled up to the familiar Walloon border checkpoint. When the soldier approached, he was bluntly told "I am SS-Standartenführer Jean-François Thiriart of the Walloon Legion, I need to speak to your commanding officer."\n\nThe guard returned to the checkpoint's office, and he emerged accompanied by an SS officer with a Legion arm patch. "SS-Sturmbannführer Saint-Antoine, reporting for duty."\n\n"Ah, you're just the man I wanted to meet!" Thiriart beamed. "Tell me, why did you deny my previous attempt to cross the border?"\n\n"There have been several industrial accidents that damaged roads and other infrastructure," the Sturmbannführer recited by rote, "overland travel is impossible for the time being."\n\n"I see," replied Thiriart, unfazed. "I have several dozen men here. Could they not help with the cleanup?"\n\n"One of the accidents was at a chemical plant and caustic toxins have contaminated the environment. It will be at least a week before the area is sufficiently cleaned up."\n\n"And why have I not been informed of an accident of such magnitude?"\n\n"The report must have become lost, sir. I shall launch an inquiry into what happened and send a new one posthaste."\n\n"Right. Adieu." Thierry ordered the convoy to turn around for the second time, returning to Ost-Paris feeling rather disgruntled. He hoped that at least bloodshed had been avoided, but he wondered whether the alternative would have been more painless..."

BRG_huntdegrelle.13.desc:0 "After what felt like an eternity of waiting, Thiriart and his convoy made a third visit to the Walloon border checkpoint. But this time, they were waved along and drove through unimpeded. Soon, the trucks were speeding past the pastures of Walloonia, and Thiriart was radioing in to other truck leaders to coordinate the beginning of the investigation. Unsurprisingly, there was no evidence whatsoever of any chemical plant leaks or industrial accidents.\n\nThis treachery was not exclusive to rogue members of the Walloon Legion. While Thiriart and his expedition  waited, Bert Erikkson and the SS-Legion Langemarck lambasted them for their so-called incompetence and failure to control their own men. If Thiriart was able to swallow his pride and approach Erikkson for assistance, the whispers went, then they already would have captured Degrelle by now.\n\nHowever, now was not a time for petty military rivalries or ethnic tensions. A traitor to the Ordensstaat was out there, and he needed to be caught..."
