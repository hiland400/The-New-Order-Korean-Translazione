 ### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_RODZAEVSKY_DESC:0 "콘스탄틴 블라디키로비치 로자예프스키는 언제나 동쪽의 사람이었습니다. 어린 시절부터 경멸해왔던 신생 소비에트 체제가 가하는 억압이 가시화되자 그는 블라고베셴스크와 연방을 떠나 백계 망명자들로 가득 찬 하얼빈으로 향했습니다. 그곳에서 볼셰비즘에 대항할 새로운 사상이 파시즘이 유럽에서 창시되었다는 사실에 확신을 얻었습니다. 초기에는 내전 패배라는 고배를 마신 그 사상이 수많은 러시아인들 사이에서 받아들여졌습니다. 젊고 카리스마있는 로자예프스키는 스바스티카 깃발 아래 그들을 통합할 기회를 움켜쥐었고 언젠가는 조국으로 돌아가고 인민을 모두 해방하겠다고 약속하는 연설로 군중을 흔들었습니다.\n\n생긴지 얼마 지나지 않아 러시아 파시스트당은 만주의 새로운 군주 일본과 밀접한 관계를 맺게 되었습니다. 당의 최대 후원자는 공산주의 정부를 무너트릴 기회가 올 때까지 전방위에서 지원을 보냈습니다.\n\n동맹국 일본의 열정적인 지원에 힘입어 파시스트당의 지도자는 유대-볼셰비즘을 격파하기 위한 고귀한 십자군에 나섰습니다. 하지만 완전한 해방이라는 꿈은 장군들과 차르, 심지어는 태평양 너머에 지원을 요청한 반역자 미하일 마트코프스키 등 수많은 경쟁자와 부딪혔습니다. 홀로 제야에 남겨져 고작 군벌 수장 중 하나로 전락한 콘스탄틴 로자에프스키는 분노에 휩싸인 채로 유대인, 빨갱이, 마트코프스키 일파, 차르주의자를 위시한 누구라도 보즈드에게 위협을 끼칠지도 모르는 모든 러시아의 적에게 복수하겠다고 다짐했습니다. 그에게 있어서 국가를 영광스러운 과거로 되돌릴 수 있는 길은 그것 뿐이지만, 그의 꿈은 점점 멀어져 가고만 있습니다."

 AMR_a_new_asano_brigade:0 "A New Asano Brigade"
 AMR_a_new_asano_brigade_desc:0 "A special episode in the history of the Russo-Japanese cooperation is the history of the Asano Brigade, an anti-Communist formation of Harbin youth that served along with the Imperial Japanese Army. Formed under the auspices of esteemed Kwantung Army officers, the Brigade proved itself as a capable force against the Communist partisans, a worthy asset to one of the strongest armies in Asia. Their valor was even compared to those of Samurai. The Brigade was eventually disbanded, with many of them participating in the struggle against Bolshevism in the Far East and later joining the anti-Communist armies of Russia, including ours.\n\nAs the matters of security against the resurgent Bolshevik threat become relevant for us both, we can petition the Imperial Japanese Army high command for the creation of the second Asano brigade, which will not only serve the purpose of the common cause between the All-Russian Government and the Empire of Japan, but also will provide us with a reliable veteran group that will aid in our later campaigns."

The almighty Zaibatsu, titans of the Asian economy, produce immesusarable amounts of guns and ammunition, most of which aren't used immediately for the service of the Imperial Japanese Army and the adjacent forces in the Sphere, but instead are stored until better times. Those tools could be very useful for us.\n\nWith insufficient arms production in our lands to compensate for the lack of equipment of our forces, we can obtain the surplus of Japanese guns and ammo for a handsome price and back up our promises to use them against our common threats, those being border bandits and Communists."

 AMR_rethinking_our_tactics:0 "Rethinking Our Tactics"
 AMR_rethinking_our_tactics_desc:0 "One of the main reasons that the RFP failed to extend their authority westwards during the initial collapse of the Union was that, quite frankly, most of the tactics and strategies that we employed were based off of archaic battle plans concocted by decrepit White Russian army officers - human waves, the supremacy of the officer, grand battle plans. What were they thinking?\n\nThose officers and their service to our cause is appreciated, but their specific contributions aren't. It's time that Rodzaevsky and his military's high command draft new strategic plans and large-unit tactics in order to best prepare ourselves for the oncoming conflicts. This way, we can ensure that the mistakes made nearly a decade ago won't be repeated."

 AMR_blackshirt_field_divisions:0 "Blackshirt Field Divisions"
 AMR_blackshirt_field_divisions_desc:0 "One of the most valuable resources that we have at our disposal are the much-feared Blackshirts: the most ideologically committed of our party members that form the core of our party's paramilitary. However, until now, we haven't been utilizing the Blackshirts to the best of their abilities.\n\nThese fascist fanatics, known for their intimidatory tactics, extreme brutality, and utter dedication to Rodzaevsky and the RFP's cause have previously been relegated to targeting civilian dissenters and ending internal opposition to the Vozhd and his RFP.\n\nHowever, Rodzaevsky has a number of ideas for how to better use the Blackshirts - primarily, to act as partisan suppression units and political commissars of sorts, installing them within and alongside our regular units to ensure cohesion and adherence to the party line, both among our soldiers and the civilians that they rule over."

 AMR_armored_cars:0 "Armored Cars"
 AMR_armored_cars_desc:0 "Decades ago, warfare in Siberia was conducted mostly by armoured trains. As technology progressed, so too did weaponry. Armoured trains evolved into armoured cars, which evolved into trucks used for troop transport and logistical support. Now more than ever, we have to take steps in order to secure and integrate new, motorized equipment into our armed forces both in frontline and logistical roles. This will help give an edge to our army's performance and help put us along the road towards a modernized, effective fighting force, especially if we form dedicated mobile units. Surely our friends in Tokyo would be able to secure some surplus equipment for us, even if we do have to pay a premium for them!\n\n"Strategic mobility, at its heart a central tenet of warfare, is an inherent trait in the Slavic race. Thus, it would only be natural that we adapt to this new equipment. Forward!""

You can expect to be eating your meal in the barracks' prison if you're not careful!"\n\nCurrently, our armed forces are a colorful mixing pot of conscripted peasants, disaffected White émigrés, and foreign mercenaries.

It's plainly obvious to anyone that the Russian is an inherently adaptable individual who is best suited not just for the romanticizes way of life of the rural peasant, but also to work in our vast industrial complexes, churning out industrial goods and weapons of war. The beating heart of Russia has, since the earliest days of industrialization, its economic and industrial might.\n\nDuring the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks and Bukharin took over, reducing the basic Russian instinct to work to a pathetic appeal towards an international worker for their nation, and when their perfidious union collapsed, the subsequent economic fallout shattered Russia's industry. It's time to rebuild."

Their economy, a sector dominated by megacorporations and the use of less-than-willing dissidents - the latter of which we have an uncountable amount - earned them the role of paramount economic power in Europe.\n\nBetter still, the corporate system that Rodzaevsky plans to borrow from the Germans was the one that won them the Second World War and earned them their spot in the powers of today - they shattered the decrepit union with Germany's economic might and sealed their fate during the West Russian War - due almost entirely to their unwavering fascist spirit and their sound economic system. By encouraging the formation of Russian megacorporations and extending the forced labor systems that we already have in place, we can take some lessons from Europe and implement it for the Russia of tomorrow."

Instead of attempting the insurmountable, we should promote class cooperation between all, from the lowest of the low to the Vozhd himself; it matters not if you are a rural peasant struggling with literacy or an industrial magnate whose heating in his home reminds him of his time spent in Harbin. All should be working towards a single goal - the goal of cooperating with one another and bridging the gap between socio-economic divides.\n\nThe Tsarists ignored the divides, and the Soviets failed in trying to eliminate the divides by killing the other classes.

Class cooperation is necessary, and there is no more important class to get on our side than those who seem to slave away in the industrial centers of our nation, day and night, to create the very finished goods that are necessary for the barest function of civilized living.\n\nThe workers are the ones who started the first revolution, and the second.

The Russian man marches on Russian food, after all, and where would we be if we did not have any of the latter?\n\nWe can institute generous agricultural grants and cheap loans to incentivize Russians to start their own farms and encourage those who are currently struggling to pull through and continue their work. We cannot - and will not - allow those to our west to outpace our agricultural production based purely on the fact that their lands are more fertile than ours.

The industrialists are the ones who are in charge of the well-being of the economy, below the Vozhd of course - but ultimately the ones who will not only stimulate the Russian economy but drive it forward into the future.\n\nThus, we need to give large government grants and legal concessions to these industrialists and the firms that they represent to ensure that we have taken care not just of the body, but the brain as well.

We should slash taxes for these wealthy individuals and their associated businesses so they're encouraged to invest further into our economy.

With some skillful and careful maneuvering, the Vozhd and a team of his most skilled and veteran diplomats, tempered by years of Russo-Japanese relations in Harbin, have begun to draft a proposal to the Japanese to ask for recognition. While the treaty would be hard-pressed to be accepted by the Emperor's Finest, we are willing to... negotiate some economic concessions in return for their international diplomatic recognition and a future of friendship and cooperation.

The Japanese have as of yet to disappoint the Vozhd in their generous "donations" of manpower and materiel. However, with our new relationship with the Great Samurai now redefined, the Vozhd has seen it fit to ask Tokyo for more than just guns - economic development, in the form of industrial equipment and the means to assemble and use it. Of course, this equipment is not free - it comes with a rather hefty price tag. That is, the free reign of Japanese companies within our territory. Surely the Japanese understand, however, our two-way relationship that surely means that the Japanese companies would respect our markets and allow our own companies to work alongside their own."

Already, the Vozhd has declared an "eternal friendship" with the Great Samurai, and Blackshirts have already begun to direct dock workers in preparation for the equipment's arrival as well as scout out perfect places for the factories. There's a lot of work ahead of us, building and operating these factories, finding people to work in them. However, this is a large step in strengthening our relationship with Tokyo."

Seized by the Japanese during the collapse of the Soviet Union, Priamurye has had a short but incredibly troublesome relationship in the hands of its current owner, Manchukuo. "Outer Manchuria", as the Manchukuoan administration has seen fit to dub it is filled with naysayers and bandits... at least, according to them. This is likely, according to the Vozhd, because those there are either rabble-roused Asiatic bandits preying on the inefficiencies of Manchukuo's pitiful police force or intensely patriotic Russians who seek nothing more than to join the All-Russian Government. Of course, the Japanese will demand more of the same - economic concessions - but the Vozhd is more than willing to give them."

The cities, what few there are, are filled to bursting with destitute homeless or worse, as well as an out of control drug trade and rampant organized crime. The countryside, however, is even worse. Territory is evenly controlled by Russian bandits and Korean communist insurgents contesting one another in a series of absurd turf wars. But this is Russian land once, and it will be again. The Vozhd has made a speech about the indomitable will of the Russian Fascist Party and its assured victory in Priamurye, even if the Vozhd's enemies are bandits and exiled Koreans. Already, trucks full of the most brutal Blackshirts have begun to arrive in the region, preparing to end the anarchy that reigns."

The Russian Fascist Party is no longer a small footnote in the history of the city of Harbin. And Konstantin Rodzaevsky is certainly no "bandit king" like his former detractors attempted to call him.

While a much smaller list of traitors, seditionists, and dissenters has been concocted, this time almost entirely composed of high-ranking Russian Fascist Party members, each name on the list is more prominent than the last.\n\nBut the Vozhd has no tolerance for even a modicum of disloyalty. Konstantin Rodzaevsky is the Russian Fascist Party, and the Russian Fascist Party is Konstantin Rodzaevsky. To wrong one is to wrong the other.

Of course, the votes never diverged much from the will of the Vozhd, but Rodzaevsky has always worried that if they really intended to, the Supreme Council could absolutely veto any progress that he would want to make.\n\nAnd this fact has caused the Vozhd stress. As such, as one of the final actions of the Second Party Congress was to have the Supreme Council take one last vote; to abolish the Council's ability to do just that.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the vote was passed unanimously."

In a speech entitled "The Dawn of a New Russia", he outlined that the final traitors and threats to his rule had been rooted out and dealt with, and while the Russian people toil onwards, he has begun planning for the final step in national reunification.

Thus, any true Russian would know that they should be united in vision - the Vozhd's vision - which will forge the way forward for a strong and independent Russia, one that is free from the tyranny of the Bolshevik and the oppression of the Jew.\n\nOf course, all true Russians would think this, but it is important to make sure that they're reminded of this.

The system needs to be exported and applied to Central Siberia, where the disgustingly-generous conditions of the workers has led to them being decadent and expecting that we bend to their desires.

And now, with most of Siberia under our direct control, this has paid off for us in quite a way.\n\nThe Vozhd believes that the Siberian Plan and its legacy can be repurposed in order to facilitate the transition to the Vozhd's vision, reforging it to ensure that we can guarantee that our Russia will be an industrial giant."

The workers, comfortable with generous concessions, must be whipped into shape. The ideological opponents to our regime must be purged, either being shot or enslaved. And the dissenters, be they from the highest or lowest rungs of society, must be rooted out and eliminated.

We always knew that the conquest of Siberia would be difficult, simply because the land that we held was much less populated than our opponent's territory. As we go west, things will only get worse.\n\nThese defeated soldiers will have to be integrated into our army if we are to have any chance at completing the Vozhd's vision.

From his time in Harbin and working with the Russian White Movement that the Japanese had harboured in opposition to the Soviet Union, Kohaku took a great interest in the language, and had learned it quite well in his years spent in Manchuria. Because of this, the aging Kempeitai agent made a natural choice for being sent to Zeya.\n\n"It's the last one, we promise, and then you're done." was what he was told when he protested the assignment.\n\nHe had wanted to retire for quite some time - he hadn't seen his hometown in decades, and he certainly wasn't getting any younger. But now, Kohaku found himself in the freezing Amur region, instructing Russian Blackshirts in the ways of dissent suppression, a hard series of lessons learned by the Kempeitai in Japan, Korea, China, and beyond. They had been instrumental in the immediate post-war, ensuring that the Co-Prosperity Sphere was secure. Kohaku himself hadn't played a significant role in that, but he had been briefed and trained on exactly what was done and how. And in turn, he would go about imparting that information on the Russians. It wasn't a perfect system, but it worked.\n\nKohaku, after a brief seminar about information extraction and torture, had found himself sat at his desk in the front of the classroom, making some notes in Japanese to send back to his handlers in Harbin - specifically about the material and its clarity. As he wrote, he was interrupted by a knock at the door.\n\n"Come in" Kohaku spoke, his Russian heavily influenced by his Japanese accent. A younger Blackshirt, perhaps no older than 24, entered. It was typically unusual to see such young "students". But Kohaku knew him - Vlas Kozlov. He was a good study, asked a lot of questions, and his reputation for brutality was already known among his older peers.\n\n"Mr. Kohaku," Kozlov spoke. "I had a question about a seminar that I had attended of yours a few days ago - you spoke about the suppression of dissent in recently-conquered territories. When you spoke, you mentioned separating families and communities based on cultural lines. What if there are no variant cultural lines to separate?"\n\nIt was a good question, Kohaku thought, before responding. "Then you look for other differences. Peasant and noble, farmer and factory worker. Anyone can conquer, but to ensure those conquests remain, you must divide. Cultural lines are the easiest to divide upon, but any division will work.""

This wasn't entirely untrue - but it wouldn't be accurate to paint Rodzaevsky's army as an entirely draconian organization. Morale was high, higher than it had ever been. Individuals like Yuri Orlov, the sixteen year old who had lied about his age to join the army, were more than just unwilling conscripts. Orlov, who had lost his father during the war with the Renegade in Magadan, was an ideological fanatic who had been indoctrinated by both his father and his schooling to believe in the Russian Fascist Party and the Vozhd was the paramount temporal authority on Earth. Star struck, and soon after his sixteenth birthday, Orlov went to the recruitment office and signed up for the army. Not exactly the perfect physical specimen, Orlov was a little shorter than most, and certainly skinnier than what he should be, likely as a result of malnutrition. That being said, he was as ideologically motivated as the most fanatical Blackshirt - and he wasn't the only one.\n\nYuri found himself and his brothers, after training one day, with nothing to do - a rare moment in the rigorous life of an All-Russian soldier. While his brethren opted to go to Church and then head into the nearest town, Yuri decided to stay back in the barracks and read. He had attained a series of pocket versions of the Vozhd's work from his local Blackshirt political officer, including the Azbuka Fashizma and Contemporary Judaisation of the World or the Jewish Question in the 20th century. Both of the works were on the older side of the Vozhd's publications, but Orlov had wanted to start from the beginning. Having stored his rifle properly, in his casual dress, Orlov had laid back on his uncomfortable bunk and opened his pocket book. The sixteen year old, who had never been exposed to any other ideology in his entire life, was enamored by the topics covered, including the toxicity of Bolshevism and the dangers of the Jewish conspiracy.

 amur.8.desc:0 "As the Gospel reading ended, the new Patriarch of Russia stepped forward to take the Deacon's place before his flock. The once-modest church in Zeya had been decorated from floor to rafters with gold and icons taken from Harbin. A great mass of blackshirts, soldiers and Amur citizens packed the floor, pressed into every corner like sardines. Those outside crowded around half-open doors, eager to hear the hierarch's first homily.\n\n"Brothers and sisters in Christ," he began, his voice filled with the stern strength of a seasoned preacher. "We live in the darkest of days. The Lord looks down upon our holy land, and surely weeps. Where once there stood a nation of wise priests, humble peasants and pious soldiers, there is now little more than ash and ruin. His chosen people have been ravaged by war, famine, pestilence and strife. We all seek answers to soothe our souls, the greatest of which must be: Whom do we hold responsible? Who has brought the ruinations of Satan to Holy Russia?"\n\nThe church was silent for a moment, save for the soft whistling of wind through loose shingling. "The Sons of Cain!" the Patriarch suddenly bellowed, his audience thoroughly enraptured. "The murderers of Christ, who have survived in the home of the faithful for generations, as rats in the walls! The Disciples of Judas, who multiply with every passing year, sup on the blood of the Lord's children and make a gruesome feast of Holy Russia! Who shall deliver us from these parasites, my flock? Who will bear the torch of the true faith and wield the scourge of Christ to drive out the Jew?"\n\nThe Patriarch raised his arms to the heavens, the sweat of adulation dripping into his ashen beard. "The Vozhd, my children! His name is unspoken prophecy fulfilled; Constantine, reborn, come to deliver Holy Russia unto salvation! His will and vision, bestowed by the Holy Spirit, will illuminate the path for our brave Christian soldiers as they sweep aside Pharisaical Bolshevism and liberate our earthly paradise from the minions of the Great Deceiver! Soon, the Lord will smile upon us once more, and all Creation will know Christ's truth of National Socialism!""

 amur.9.t:0 "The Paranoid Vozhd"
 amur.9.desc:0 "Konstantin Rodzaevsky, Vozhd of all Russians and the true leader of the Russian Fascist Party drifted into his office in his traditional pseudo-military garb. Removing his hat, he set it down on his archaic oaken desk and ran a hand through his grizzled hair. "Another sleepless night..." he grumbled to himself as he sat himself in his chair, sighing as he did so. Reports of troop movements, suspected traitors, and production quotas had already been placed neatly on his desk, likely by some orderly or assistant whose name he couldn't be bothered to remember. They were all signed by his confidant - Bolotov - who had become one of his closest allies in the past decade. He didn't even bother with any of the reports except those regarding suspected traitors. Opening the portfolio marked "internal dissent", Rodzaevsky reviewed some of the names, muttering to himself. "Bogachyov... Tkachyov... " His eyebrows raised at the third name he read - Ryzhov. Mikhail Ryzhov had been an extremely loyal senior party official in Zeya, and Rodzaevsky had known him personally for a number of years, but it sort of made sense. About a year back, he had made a joke about the party's financial infrastructure in Zeya, and Bolotov had produced some fairly convincing evidence that linked him to the long-gone Zeya banker, Berezhnoy, who had attempted to hide his Jewish ancestry. The Vozhd grimaced. Replacing Ryzhov would be a pain, but if he had fraternized with Berezhnoy, what other company had he been keeping? He picked up the phone on his desk, and dialled his trusted security minister. "I've seen the new lists. Move on Ryzhov. Move on them all."\n\nThe truth was that Ryzhov was innocent. The only contact he ever had with Berezhnoy was when he verbally assaulted him for his Jewish ancestry. The Vozhd's paranoia had clouded his judgment but as long as Bolotov kept producing "traitors", Rodzaevsky's paranoia would be sated. Ever since the Renegade split the party and the united front fell apart, the All-Russian State was dominated by the Vozhd's suspicions."

 amur.10.desc:0 "The Supreme Council met once a day, usually in the mornings, seven days a week in the capital of the All-Russian Government. The building they met in, a converted hotel, was made to look much grander than it really was. A giant, glowing swastika, akin to the one that Rodzaevsky had installed in the RFP building in Manzhouli decades ago, had been placed on the top of the old hotel. Ostensibly, the Supreme Council was a body of government that would determine laws, enforce ordinances, and help guide the Vozhd in his quest to reunite Russia. However, to any independent observer, it would seem closer to a king and his court than a council of equals. Truthfully, the Supreme Council wielded little power. Most members were the oldest thugs from the RFP, back when it was an exiled movement in Harbin, and for the most part, none of them dared challenge the policies of the Vozhd, especially in his current volatile moods.\n\nThus, the Supreme Council was more of Rodzaevsky's echo chamber than an actual functioning arm of the government. That being said, it didn't prevent the paranoid Vozhd from thinking that there were dissenters, even among his oldest and most trusted advisors. So when the Council met this morning, Rodzaevsky, Bolotov, and Okhotin stood at the end of the conference room and watched as one in every three council members were forced out of their seats by Blackshirts and arrested for Anti-Russian activities. In the coming days all of those arrested would be publically trialled and hung, their names stricken from the party registry, and their memory buried.\n\n"Finally," Rodzaevsky would mention to Bolotov, "we've secured the highest echelons of our party's leadership".\n\nThe security minister tacitly agreed. "Of course, my Vozhd. They were plotting. I'm glad we're rid of them." Even Bolotov had begun to doubt the extent of his purges - how long before Rodzaevsky turned on him?"

"But why has he called me in?" Bolotov had asked himself as he hurried to the Vozhd's residence. Had he finally outlived his usefulness?\n\nWhen Bolotov let himself into Rodzaevsky's study, he found the Vozhd with a bottle of vodka and a series of documents on his desk. Bolotov had recognized them immediately - they were the ones that he had given the Vozhd the evening prior. He had snuck in with the rest of his reports a dossier about the activities of Lev Okhotin, Rodzaevsky's longtime second-in-command. Embezzlement and bribery were the charges levelled towards him, and a faintly traceable path of the money was included in the dossier. As Bolotov let himself in, Rodzaevsky didn't even greet him.\n\n"Is this true?" he asked. The tone of his voice evidenced his exhaustion, but the look in his eyes showed betrayal - but more than that, bloodshot and with bags. The rumors were true; the Vozhd was an insomniac. Bolotov didn't even try to feign ignorance.\n\n"It's what the evidence shows, my Vozhd. I couldn't believe it myself. Lev's been stealing from the party for... well years maybe". There was a pause.\n\n"And what of the bribery? Can we look into those who took the money Okhotin offered?" Rodzaevsky asked. The security minister grimaced.\n\n"Unfortunately not, my Vozhd... You see the names there, Kvassov and Bogachyov, both executed for treason, the latter last week. Seems like we caught them first." There was a second, prolonged silence, Bolotov awkwardly standing in front of Rodzaevsky's desk. Rodzaevsky lethargically waved his hand.\n\n"Dismissed."\n\nAs Bolotov saw himself out, the Vozhd's mind raced. Could Okhotin have hidden this for so long? How could he have done this? Or was this just a play by Bolotov to remove competition?"

Ultimately, the Vozhd's opinion won out. Despite Okhotin's betrayal, he couldn't bring himself to humiliate one of his closest friends and followers. He had stuck with him for better or for worse for decades. Lev Okhotin was quietly arrested following a Supreme Council meeting and taken to one of the many political prisons that contained those doomed for execution or deemed not important enough to kill. Once there, he was beaten mercilessly by the very Blackshirts that he had helped induct into the program, professing his innocence and dedication to the Vozhd the entire time. Eventually Rodzaevsky himself came to visit his old friend. As the door to the interrogation room swung open, the Vozhd and Okhotin stared at one another. One, a paranoid insomniac with sunken eyes, a grizzled look, and aged well beyond his years. The other, an older man, completely bald, skin mottled and pockmarked from years of alcoholism and harsh weather, beaten to a pulp. Both were radically different men than they were back in Harbin.\n\n"Get out", the command was quietly uttered to the Blackshirts who had been assigned to guard Okhotin. As they filed out, Rodzaevsky stopped the last one from leaving. "You, stay", he ordered. Rodzaevsky, coat hung around his slumped figure, approached Okhotin, tied to a chair in the middle of the room. He kneeled down to eye level with his friend. After a pause, Rodzaevsky asked, "Why? Why would you do this?"\n\nLev answered through swollen lips, "I've done noth-" the Vozhd cut him off.\n\n"Shut up!" he yelled. "You, kill him." He said to the remaining Blackshirt as he stood, who pulled out a pistol.\n\nOkhotin understood then - eyes widening, he began to speak. "I profess my loyalty to Russia and my Vozhd! For God, Nation, and-".\n\nA gunshot between the eyes cut Okhotkin off, killing him instantly."

 amur.13.desc:0 "One of the few remaining organizations within the Vozhd's territory with the intent to end the rule of Konstantin Rodzaevsky were the Sons of the Tsar, a minor group of monarchists who were sympathetic to Mikhail II's cause. They mostly occupied lower bureaucratic positions in the town of Rodzaevsk, previously protected by the incompetence of the Manchukuoan authorities and utterly cut off from the White Movement in the east. They had been hiding in plain sight, so to speak. That was, until, one of their members had lost his nerve. Following an interrogation, standard procedure by the Blackshirts for rooting out traitors, he had decided to come clean. Approaching the party's head office in Rodzaevsk, he told the officials everything he knew. Plans, meeting places, individuals involved and their degree of involvement. When he was done, the party officials laughed. One mentioned that they had taken down resistance movements three times as large as his. They promised him immunity from prosecution, but on his way out, he was promptly arrested.\n\nThe man, forced into a truck with a number of Blackshirts, was brought out and forced to bear witness as every member of his dissenting movement was rooted out. Each time, the Blackshirts made a big show of the man's role in the collapse of the movement, curtseying and bowing in the most sarcastic of manners, and thanking him in superfluous ways, patting him on the back and acting as if they were his best friend, all in front of his former compatriots who he had helped bust. As the last of the names on the list were ticked off, the man was taken to the outskirts of the city and shot, ultimately being left unburied. The rest were simply imprisoned in the work camps and relegated to forced labour - for while it may be terrible to be a traitor, there's nothing worse than being a traitor to the traitors, for no honor at all is spared."

 amur.14.desc:0 "The Rodzaevsk Officer's Academy was far from a glorious building. In Zeya, the Vozhd had put a significant amount of time and money into restoring a building for the RFP's military officers to ensure that they would have a comfortable and prestigious place to train and learn. However, its sister complex in the Vozhd's hometown was a far cry from Zeya. A two-storey converted schoolhouse, it was used both for official RFP duties as well as for the training and drilling of local officers before they were sent off to the fronts. One such use for the building was the implementation of the loyalty tests that Rodzaevsky himself came up with. In a classroom, about thirty members of the party were crammed into small desks to take these tests - from novice Blackshirts to aging Orthodox priests, it seemed that anyone even remotely tied to the regime was preparing to write the tests. At the front of the classroom, a grim-looking Blackshirt, perhaps in his late 50's stood, his sidearm intentionally very visible. He barked the instructions for the test as if they were slaves in a labour camp rather than party officials.\n\n"You get one hour! You must answer all questions posed. No questions are to be asked to either your neighbours or to me. Anyone caught cheating or attempting to cheat will be punished in a harsh manner. When you are done, bring your paper up to the front. After that, you will leave. Do not wait around. You may start."\n\nLittle did most of the test takers know, but the very man giving the tests in the first place just passed his the day before. Flying colours, of course, as that is what the Vozhd demanded out of each and every person who is associated with the party. For those who did not perform up to the standards set, consequences ranged from being stripped of their title and party role to being sent to the forced labour camps for the fear of traitors.\n\nAs Rodzaevsky would go on to comment to his supreme council, "All this to ensure the security of the party.""

He felt like he would've gone insane at some point.\n\nThere was something keeping him grounded, however-- or, rather, someone. The voice snapped him back to reality and he felt his arms tire in carrying the barrow. Focusing again, he could make it out as Ilyanov. Turning to face the man, they exchanged warm smiles, and Pushkin felt immediately better. "Hello, Ilyanov." He said, beginning to push the barrow. "How are you?"\n\n"How am I?" He asked, letting out a chuckle. Ilyanov was thin, almost wiry, but he wasn't starved. Pushkin found that an attractive trait amongst many in him. "I should ask you that question! Come on, cheer up, we'll get out of this prison and make something of our lives!" Pushkin's breathing became a bit awkwardly paced. "... Did you just say our?"\n\nIlyanov's eyes narrowed, and he gave a sly smile. "I don't have to repeat myself, you know. In fact," he began, walking closer and deciding to chat with Pushkin to pass the time until a guard noticed him. "It was your idea to begin with. A nice cabin out in the woods of Siberia. You always wanted to be a hunter." Pushkin gave a bit of a shaky grin. "W-well, I... I did say that, didn't I? But..." He looked around the camp once again. It was of a dreadful atmosphere.

 amur.16.desc:0 "After the purge of the Supreme Council, the Vozhd had a vested interest in ensuring that the governing body of his All-Russian State was back up to full strength. A series of names were put forward by both the remaining members of the Supreme Council as well as Bolotov himself, each of them vetted carefully for potential loyalty issues, as well as examinations of their past actions as members of the Russian Fascist Party. Name by name was eliminated from the list; Andreev had a history of minor insubordination, Viktorov had too many friends in low places, and Isaev just wasn't really liked by the rest of the council. These were just a few examples. Eventually, however, a series of names were chosen. Loyal, skilled, and fanatical were the trio of traits that the decision was ultimately based on. The new Supreme Council, between the survivors of the purge and the new members, had become an incredibly loyal institution to Rodzaevsky - in reality, little more than an echo chamber for his thoughts and direction.\n\n"Repeat after me: I believe in the One God. I promise to serve the One True Vozhd. I will do so loyally and with complete faith and confidence in his decisions and beliefs. I believe in the Russian Fascist Party and its ability to unite all Russians under one banner. For God, Nation, and Labour!"\n\nThe ceremony for swearing in the Supreme Council was unannounced to the public and remained an austere occasion. Undertaken in the early morning, little decoration or celebration was given, but as Rodzaevsky had finished confirming each new member of the council, he gave them a tri-colored sash of black, gold, and white, adorned with a single, iron swastika. A short, curt welcome and congratulations were given by the Vozhd, before instructing them where they needed to sit and the various responsibilities that they would need to fulfill for their position. As the ceremony wound down, the morning ceremony progressed into a standard daily meeting of the Supreme Council. The new members, led by the old, filed into the conference room, where the Vozhd took his place at the head of the council.

For weeks, the city had been bustling - not only were people going about their standard lives, but they had also attended show trials, watched the executions of traitors, and snitched on their neighbours and loved ones. The past few weeks had been hard on everybody, and the fanatical pace at which both the purges and the subsequent executions had taken clearly had inflicted a collective toll on the capital's population. No more evident was this fact than in Konstantin Fedorov, a minor party official that had only narrowly escaped persecution himself by turning in his brother, Alexei, for "Anti-Russian Activities". Fedorov had been working late shifts to process extra paperwork, effectively pushing pencils for higher-ups who couldn't be bothered. It was often said that the Russian Fascist Party was a living, breathing thing and people like Fedorov were what kept it alive. Regardless, Fedorov had, with some skill, some betrayal, and a lot of luck, avoided the purges. And he wasn't exactly sure how he did, nor how he felt about it.\n\nFederov walked his standard after work walk back to the measly apartment that he shared with his deceased brother's wife and daughter, neither of whom knew that it had been Fedorov who had given him over to the party. Up one street, to the left, cross the street, and Fedorov found himself on his final stretch home - past the Zeya gallows. He distinctly remembered how, at the very center of the town, near the gallows, there seemed to be a persistent din, cheering, jeering, screaming, gun shots. He had become so used to it that the first thing he noticed while walking past the gallows was the complete silence. No one in the square, no one to be seen in the evening twilight, with what little light was left supplemented by the town's streetlights. Fedorov did something that he had not done in weeks: he stopped. And he listened. A smile crept across the junior bureaucrat's face. Silence. Complete, and utter quiet. As if a giant boulder had been released from his shoulders, Fedorov felt free. Were the purges over for good? Who cared, thought Fedorov, for right now, he was free. Free from guilt, free from threat. He offered a prayer to God before walking the rest of the way home, a skip in his step."

The speech was incredibly well received, even among most of the common folk, who were "politely asked" about it. The speech was even broadcasted across the airwaves, and in an incredibly rare move, also televised, to the few Russians who had a television. The work, which would become known as the Zeya Balcony Speech, roused the armed forces and officially announced Rodzaevsky's intentions to reclaim the total leadership of the Russian Fascist Party and end the False Tsar's farcical regime in Chita. Compared to the state that the Vozhd had been in not a year prior, to see him reinvigorated and once again passionate against his enemies assuaged the fears of many in the Blackshirts and the military, who had begun to doubt his competency for leadership following his slide into paranoia."

The RFP's officials had packed the square with Blackshirts and peasants with the promise of a banquet afterwards, in celebration of the death of the False Tsar. The crowd's mood had gone from quietly excited to raucous with the arrival of Mikhail and his escort of Blackshirts. Despite having been wearing prison clothes for most of his time in the city, he had been dressed up in his Tsarist regalia for the execution. It appeared as if the deposed "royal" had aged considerably since his capture. The Blackshirts forced a path through the crowd, and curbed the worst of the physical abuse that was being hurled at Mikhail, who was being propelled forward, a Blackshirt grasping each of his arms and forcing him to walk. The entire journey to the gallows, through the crowd, the False Tsar protested, begged for mercy, and pleaded with his escorts to let him go. This only played into the showiness of the event, and caused surges of excitement amongst the younger Blackshirts who were accosting him.\n\nAs he was led up to the gallows, alongside the executioner was the RFP-appointed Patriarch of the Orthodox Church of the East and the Vozhd himself. The Patriarch performed the Last Rites and performed a prayer for Mikhail's soul in the afterlife. Rodzaevsky remained silent the entire time, watching the process and reveling in the scene that Mikhail was making for himself. As he was being prepared to be hung, the executioner asked if he had any last words.\n\nTearfully, the False Tsar said, "I... I never wanted any of this... Please, just...

He would not even admit his crimes - splitting the party, Anti-Russian activities, breaches of morality and decency - either under duress or on the stand. It's clear that he's guilty, of course, but he isn't playing into the show that Rodzaevsky had hoped he would put on. Regardless, the execution would go forward; it had to.\n\nThe central square of Zeya, once the market that had since been transformed into the town's gallows for all of the Vozhd's ideological enemies, had been packed with a number of Blackshirts and senior members of the RFP. Each one had been picked based on their relation to the party and Matkovsky himself - they had either known him directly, or had been affected by the fallout of his splitting of the party. Losing friends or family to the split and the subsequent purges on all sides resulted in dozens of members of the RFP being more than happy to attend the execution. As Matkovsky was brought up to the gallows, jeers and insults were hurled at him by the crowd, all of whom had been roused to believe that the man was responsible for their hardships. Once he was brought up, Rodzaevsky himself was waiting there to greet him. Looking him directly in the eye, the Vozhd asked him: "Any last words?" Silence followed, as Matkovsky stared back, awkward seconds passing by. Frustrated by his silence, Rodzaevsky threw a punch, landing on his captive's cheek.

But his head wasn't in the right place to receive the sort of news they were offering. Eyes nominally looking at reports, but glazed over, the Vozhd politely listened to the group, before dismissing them once he was sure that they had finished. As they filed out of the room, Rodzaevsky turned his entire attention to what was on his mind - the past decade of his life. From a fiery preacher-esque figure in Harbin, to the warlord of a pseudo-statelet in the Amur region, and finally his triumph over his enemies and the reunification of the Russian Fascist Party.\n\nBut he remembered too, quite well, a time when his enemies were not enemies at all - in fact, he had even called some of them friends. The atmosphere of Harbin and the scarcity of resources in their struggle made cooperation between the Whites and the fascists, both pragmatic and fanatically ideological, absolutely necessary. There were always arguments, but there were both good times and bad. Sharing dinner and a vodka with Ataman Semyonov, for example, or drunkenly belting out White Army songs with Matkovsky from his balcony into the chilly, Manchurian night. Rodzaevsky remembered - if only for a brief minute - that his friends-turned-enemies were more than just targets: they were humans. After all the work that the Vozhd went through, all the painstaking measures to dehumanize his enemies, he couldn't shake the fact that they were, after all, people. People, with some of whom he had once shared real connections with. He sighed, and glanced at the report left on his desk by Bolotov. Humans, maybe, Rodzaevsky thought, but still traitors. The Vozhd, with a strong mental push, dismissed his thoughts and reminiscences and picked up the report. He read it - every word, in fact - and found it satisfying.\n\n"Look at how far we've come..." he muttered to himself. Reminiscing on the past quickly transitioned into preparing for the future.

Remember that while the Jew poisons the blood, the Communist corrupts the soul! There is no redemption in this life for a Bolshevik, even if they are a friend or family member. The only thing you can do for their wretched souls is hasten their journey to Hell, where they might find some spiritual redemption. By allowing them to continue living amongst us, you only damn more of your own Russian brothers and sisters! Every Bolshevik spared will turn countless children to worship of the Red Judas, Lenin, and turn your wives and daughters into whores for the Jewish pigs! Remember this lesson, and do your duty to God and your race! Glory to Russia!"\n\nThe radio fell into crackling static for a moment before someone in a broadcast station flicked a switch and started up the usual patriotic music.

Even behind the blindfold, Sablin squeezed his eyes shut and gritted his teeth as the pained voices of people he knew personally drifted to him on the frigid wind.\n\nThe noisome chaos of the village soon faded from earshot as the truck picked up speed and began navigating a rough back road. An hour or so passed before they finally came to a stop and Sablin was roughly manhandled out of the truck's flatbed. Half-dragged, half-stumbling, he found himself thrown bodily against a wall. Someone grabbed him by the collar and ripped the blindfold away. He saw that night had fallen, and his captor's flashlights dazzled him briefly. Shadows moved beyond the edge of the light - shadows with rifles at the ready. Glancing around, he noted the blood and bullet-holes marking the cottage wall he had been put against. His eyes tracked downwards to the source, and Sablin's heart plummeted.\n\nBraun. Pechuro. Ulanovskaya. His close friends and a dozen more, slumped against the whitewashed surface with blood pooled about them, riddled with holes. "No," he whispered, voice hollow. "Fascist monsters."

Stones, rotten food and feces pelted the bald, gremlin-faced NKVD chief throughout his agonizing journey to the center of town.\n\nBy the time he was dragged up a narrow set of stairs to a wooden platform in the town square, Yagoda was barely conscious. Blood ran from a dozen small cuts on his scalp and face. His white uniform was sullied with both his own filth and that which had been thrown at him. "He's not dead already, is he?" someone shouted angrily. "If you've fucked up, I'll hang you next to him!"\n\n"No, my Vozhd! You see?" someone slugged Yagoda in the face, eliciting a whimper. "He's still alive, but we'd better do him quick!"\n\n"No," sneered the first voice. Yagoda found himself hauled upright before a face he'd become familiar with during his investigations of the Harbin exiles, albeit aged and grizzled: Konstantin Rodzaevsky. "Make sure that noose isn't too tight, Bolotov," the Vozhd remarked as a noose was roughly pulled down around Yagoda's neck.

Some spoke of his plain appearance, others of his supposed sorcerous powers. All were tinged by fear of what might come as a consequence of his demise.\n\nEven the Patriarch, avowed follower of the Church and the Vozhd, conducted the last rites with trembling hands. The Blackshirts standing alongside the condemned glanced around nervously and tapped their feet, wishing only for the sense of discomfort - of wrongness - to end. Men's quiet prayers wormed their way into the ears of those around him. There was no acknowledgement of the noose being fastened around his neck.\n\nThe lever clunked.

Only his face and hands were exposed to the chilly air of his makeshift headquarters, intense eyes tracing across the page before him as his numb fingers scrawled out a new addition to his manifesto of Russian National Socialism. The ancient clock on the wall chimed a single peal, signifying that 1 o'clock in the morning had come, as he reached the bottom of the page and downed his pen.\n\nIt was the third night in a row that Rodzaevsky had stayed up late to continue work on his magnum opus. He had thought it complete long ago, but the sudden collapse of Red authority and the mockery of Russia it maintained had changed the situation. Without the aid of the Japanese, he had gone from Harbin to distant Zeya on the river Amur in just a few short days. In that short period of time just a few years prior, the fortunes of the Russian Fascist Party had changed completely.\n\nThat hadn't lasted long, of course. The thought of Matkovsky's betrayal and the split of the RFP stoked the fire of hate in the Vozhd's gut, and he reached for the flask of vodka beside him to quench it. The taste, vile and stomach-churning as the betrayal, did little to soothe his temper, but he ignored it and took another deep swig - it would do its job eventually. In that, it was just like the assorted rabble that his statelet called an army. Crude, ill-formed, hammered out of whatever was lying around to make something functional. But it was his - it was Russia's. For only here was Russia to be found. Beyond Amur's borders, there lay only traitors, subhumans, and Reds, their collective boot on the throat of the Russian people.\n\nSomeday, he would have his chance.

The region is not particularly impressive in terms of its mineral wealth, and it is full of ethnic Russians whom we have no reason to displace.\n\nThe Manchurians expressed their profound indifference to the matter when it was brought to their government, so there's no need to bother getting them to rubber-stamp it. All other authorities concerned have made clear that they don't care about a frozen stub of land full of Russians, and Rodzaevsky is offering us rights to the resources in far-eastern Siberia once he secures the region. Though unlikely to happen, it would allow for some interesting investment opportunities should he succeed, so there's nothing to lose from ceding the lands in question.

This morning, a one-man Japanese delegation arrived by plane to formally hand over the territory, with the Vozhd putting his signature to the agreement in his Zeya headquarters.\n\nIn return for ceding Blagoveshchensk, we have granted the Japanese special rights to some of the natural resources in far-eastern Siberia. Once we secure those resources and unite the region under a stable government, the resultant trade and mining deals will no doubt prove extremely fruitful for our reborn Russian state!\n\nFor now, the Vozhd has publicly confirmed that he will travel to his hometown post-haste for a grand celebration now that it is officially back in Russian hands.

There is only one thing left to do.\n\nRodzaevsky finishes his thundering speech, takes a cursory glance at the assorted smaller ships that had been equally refurbished and takes the bottle placed next to him. In a more civilised age, that bottle would have contained champagne, but for now local vodka will have to do.\n\nOne hefty swing and the bottle speeds toward the battleship's rump, hits it with a deep clong and then... doesn't break.

A number of very prominent figures were there - all of them members of the RFP, having grown fat off of war profiteering during the first stage of the reunification.\n\nThese industrialists, while none of them prominent party officials, had been chosen to head the first of the Russian megacorporations that Rodzaevsky had envisioned - their ideological dedication to the cause, longtime membership in the party, or "donating" enough money all "qualified" them for the positions. As they convened to discuss the future of their megacorporations, they sat down in the conference room that would determine the economic future of Rodzaevsky's Russia.\n\nAfter some intense deliberation, an incredibly controversial idea was floated among the industrialists: the repurposing of forced labor for the purposes of vast and rapid economic growth by the megacorporations that the Vozhd had envisioned. Surely, not the most humane idea and one that emulated the German model of forced labor in their industrial sector, many of the industrialists took an initial distaste for the idea. However, as it was discussed more and more, almost all realized the benefits of what was being proposed: labor and manpower that was virtually free. While it would surely decrease the quality and quantity of the goods produced, it would also mean a net profit for those tasked with creating exactly that.\n\nAs the industrialists and their attendants indulged in coffee and luxurious, exotic foods imported from Japan, they barely thought of the thousands of lives they would resign to horrific conditions in the factories that they believed would ensure the Vozhd's victory."

Devoid of any morality, love or faith, she ends her life as a ruined, dishonored and drug-addicted Jezebel. Such is how the Jews would have you, as well! To embrace Western feminism is to cast off all that makes a woman pure and godly.\n\nIn Russia, we understand that God has a place for us all. For men, that place is on the frontlines and in the factories. For you, blessed wives, sisters, daughters and mothers, that place is in the safety of the home and church. You are empowered by the Lord to bear life anew! Only from your natural state can happiness spring - the joy of raising children; of welcoming your man home after a hard day's work; of finding comfort in the embrace of the masculine sex!"

Both of them had provided the Vozhd with a series of very long lists: individuals and their families who were either Jews, communists, or were simply too cozy with either group. The lists were way too long for the Vozhd to read them personally. As the pair had come in with their respective lists, Rodzaevsky had looked from the lists, sitting on his desk, back to the pair. "Is this everyone?" he asked the pair of them.\n\nThe pair looked at each other, rivals briefly united in intention. "This is the start, my Vozhd." Bolotov answered, "There's a lot more where this is coming from."\n\nThe Vozhd nodded his head in understanding. He thought for a minute, before grimacing. "These bastards," he started. "These complete bastards." A brief pause, before he continued. "Jews. Communists. These creatures have long plagued our nation. They've infiltrated our people, our culture, and morphed it, weakened it... they've made us rot, turned once-brave Russians into cowardly fools. Made the bravest tepid, the strongest weak. And for years they have done this, and no one has had the courage to do anything about it."\n\nBoth Shekerev and Bolotov nodded, not out of fear, but genuine belief; the looks in their eyes betrayed their zeal. The Vozhd continued. "This is a good start. But it's not enough. We need to purge the rot, to cut out the infection by any means necessary. I want these names taken care of. But I want more names.

And yet we are still here! The last of the true have overcome their oppressors and risen to their rightful place as leaders of Siberia!"\n\n"But do not let success dull your perception, for it is a candle in the wind, burning bright in fits and starts, and in the darkness lie those who wish to snuff it out. We do not tolerate the inequities of Bolshevism, and so the Bolshevik remnants protest and try to bring us down. We do not tolerate parasitism, and so the parasites cry out and seek our demise. As the shadow of our stature grows, so grows the shadows in which the agents of Zionism can scheme against us."\n\n"Do not fail to be vigilant, for if you fail to spot a traitor, it is as if you had betrayed the Russian people and enacted the plot yourself. We have come far, but before the Russian nation is secure, we must go farther. It is the duty of every citizen to be on watch for the spies of the false government to our west, the lying communist, and the scheming Jew, for they can only work against us in the darkness.

Ripping open the curtains of his apartment's sole window, he saw what was unfolding down on the street.\n\nA crowd of maybe a hundred people were shuffling their way down the street. Some looked far worse off than others. A few dragged large suitcases behind them, but most had nothing save the clothes on their backs. Grigori was puzzled for a moment - then he saw the rifle-toting blackshirts at their flanks, and the pieces fell into place.\n\nAs the crowd moved on, towards the walled ghetto that had been erected over the past several weeks, Grigori sighed and returned to his seat, putting the sorry sight behind him. The last time he had seen persecution in action, it had been in the name of the Tsar. Now it was in the name of some 'Vozhd' and an ideology dreamed up by a mad German.

The name is merely the first indication that this is the center of the Vozhd's control. No corner or alleyway is free of the eyes and ears of loyal party members, on the lookout for traitors to hand up the chain of command. And the most attentive of them are within the Party Congress. Dozens of supposedly loyal party members have been exposed as Zionist sympathizers in the past days, at the behest of the true loyalists. A deceased cousin who married a Jew, a brother who visited family in Magadan before the reconquest, even a lapsed registration at the headquarters years ago, all are enough to draw suspicion and arrest.\n\nGeorgy Shekerev recuses himself from the congress, preferring to stalk amongst the shadows in the back and watch for suspicious behavior, or listen for further information he can use. While his Blackshirts patrol the halls of the building and the streets of Rodzaevsk, he must personally report what he has heard to the Vozhd- other party members cannot be trusted, according to Rodzaevsky, and Shekerev cannot lose his credibility. Not without severe consequences.\n\nEven more conspicuous is Aleksandr Bolotov, who makes himself quite visible during the Congress. Those who are seen cannot be conspiring, and may be more loyal than those who have something to hide. The Vozhd sees Bolotov working on his behalf, and is pleased to see the loyalty of his inner circle. Yet Bolotov is more active and alert than Shekerev, knowing his position of favor depends on his ability to find and out those who oppose the Vozhd.\n\nAnd in the center of the event, the Vozhd himself sniffs out conspiracy, always alert for Jewish sympathizers or traitors within the RFP. Now that the party had been purged of its disloyal members, the only way to go was west, to the unreclaimed lands of the Russian nation. When the remainder of the puppets had been wiped out, then Russia would be free, free to forge her own destiny without malign influences."

Shekerev's men watched the entrance constantly, and only on rare occasions was Bolotov able to speak to the Vozhd privately.\n\nHe knocked, head twitching back and forth to look for black shirts, then whipped his head back to the door as Rodzaevesky snapped at him from inside.\n\n"Enter!"\n\nHe slipped into the room quickly. The Vozhd sat behind the desk, glaring at his lieutenant. "Soratnik Bolotov. It's good you're here. I need you to investigate something for me. Reports of smugglers in the port of Magadan. Shekerev says they're remnants of the traitors, intent on causing trouble for us until their last dying breath."\n\nNormally being interrupted in his goals in such a manner would have upset Bolotov, and in his younger days he would have taken out his frustrations on a random victim snatched from the streets of Harbin. But decades of loyal service to the Vozhd had taught him much of the man, and this was an opportunity to advance his cause, not a burden to be taken on.\n\n"We seem to be beset by enemies on all sides, my Vozhd. Might I make a suggestion?"\n\n"Speak, Aleksandr." Was that irritation he detected?\n\n"Soratnik Shekerev's men seem to have proven... unable to keep out the pernicious influence of our enemies. The blackshirts have served our purposes well, but they are lacking in organization and equipment. I suggest we create a newer, more specialized unit, with proper military training and advanced education on how to spot enemies of the state.

Under the nose of Shekerev, he had triumphed and received permission for his own power base. But there were still many obstacles. He would need weapons, uniforms, a network of bureaucracy to manage the lists, and many more resources.\n\nStill, his star was certainly rising. The trust of the Vozhd was rare, and it was common for it to ebb and flow on Rozaevsky's whim.

Well, he would pay on the day the loyalty of the Blackshirts failed!\n\nNo, this would not do. It was not fitting for a Russian to behave in such a manner. The Vozhd would see reason, for if he did not, what hope was there for Russia? Rodzaevsky was the future, and he needed guidance- guidance that could not be provided by Shekerev. This thought comforted him, for the will of the Vozhd was strange but not entirely unpredictable.\n\nBolotov smiled. Another set of lists at the right time, and the Vozhd would see reason. He could not dare ask about the OOB again, but the paranoia of Rodzaevsky always manifested, and guaranteed a chance to bring himself back to his side and outmaneuver the Blackshirts, all by himself.

With a sluggish pace he opened his eyes and gave a half-hearted glance at the alarm clock on his nightstand. Rodzaevsky's sight was blurred, and he could not make out the time at first. After a moment, his eyes finally adjusted and revealed the hour: half past two in the afternoon.\n\nHis head still aching and his body still sapped of energy, Rodzaevsky clumsily rolled out of his bed and landed on the floor with a loud thud. He hacked out a few pained coughs and mumbled an obscenity, but was still too groggy to be fazed by the slight pain the fall gave him. When everything already hurts, what was a little more going to do? Pulling himself together, Rodzaevsky rose to his feet and opened the blinds to his window revealing the near-perpetually frozen city of Zeya. Light flooded into the poorly-lit room, and the sudden burst of sunlight caused Rodzaevsky to flinch. The vast view his third-story room had given him quickly reminded the Fascist leader of his recent accomplishments.\n\nThis land, from Lake Baikal in the West to Kamchatka in the East, was his and his alone. All of Rodzaevsky's enemies were either dead or wishing they were, and his dread armies had their boots firmly on the neck of the Russian Far East. This thought gave Rodzaevsky a great deal of comfort. Looking out into the distance, Rodzaevsky began to feel excitement for the future that he had not felt in some time. If these victories were to continue, he thought, all of Russia would be at his mercy, along with all of the "undesirables" hiding therein..."

As we are both nations who closely follow the tenets of the late, great Adolf Hitler, it would make a great deal of sense to reach common ground in diplomatic terms, no? Regrettably, our state still struggles to attain recognition amongst the nations of the world. No doubt this is the work of powerful Jewish elites who would like nothing more than to see our movement ground into dust before it can truly challenge their reign of terror over the world.\n\nGermany, however, is different. Your mighty people have rejected the Jew and their insidious plans for global domination, and it is because of this that I reach out to this great nation for recognition as the true heir to Russia's legacy, a legacy untarnished by the darkness of Judeo-Bolshevism. Although it is indeed true that our two peoples have not seen eye-to-eye in the past, perhaps we could use this opportunity to begin a new chapter for Russo-German relations, dutifully united as ideological brethren.

The Foreign Minister himself found it tempting to read for himself, just to see what all the fuss was about. Now that he had read it a few times, he wasn't quite sure what to think.\n\nFrom top to bottom, the letter made little sense and seemed as though it was written by an incredibly disturbed individual. Claiming to be from the "Vozhd of Holy Russia", the letter explains that a certain region in Russia had been reconquered in the name of the "National Socialist cause". As the mad writings continue, this "Vozhd" states his intentions to seek recognition from the Reich, for he is of the belief that all-powerful international Jews conspire against his new state and seek to smother it in the crib. As he believes that German people have "rejected the Jew", the "Vozhd" considers the Reich to be his best bet at attaining international recognition.\n\nAfter some time, the minister came to the conclusion that the letter was some kind of poor attempt at a hoax. Throwing the crumpled letter into the bin by his desk, the Foreign Minister took this turn of events as a sign that perhaps the time had come for some new vetting protocols. The thinly-stretched Ministry's time was important, and wasting it on aspiring comedians sending them nonsense letters was simply not something they could afford."

Across the entire room, tucked away in one of the corners was a trio of drinking chairs and a small table in between them. While Rodzaevsky sat behind his desk, his foreign minister, Spasovsky, sat in the chair facing the Vozhd, quietly observing the temperamental dictator.\n\n"How many days has it been?" Rodzaevsky asked.\n\n"Seven, sir." Spasovsky replied, pausing before he spoke, the words only reluctantly leaving his mouth. Two or three seconds of silence passed as Rodzaevsky's temper grew and grew until it boiled over. He picked up his glass of vodka and threw it across the room, sailing at incredible speed until it impacted upon the wall just over the aging Spasovsky's head. The foreign minister winced as particles of glass and vodka sprinkled over his head.\n\n"SEVEN FUCKING DAYS?!" roared Rodzaevsky. "ALL OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE, FOR NOTHING?!

Now, seated in a bar in Irkutsk, Kazimir felt that he had finally succeeded in his quest. This - the peace of his home city, liberated from Reds - was what he'd been fighting for all these years. The street brawls in Harbin, the voyage on a rickety old Japanese destroyer, the bloody battles against splitters and communists - it was all worth it for this. For the glory, for the Vozhd, for Russia. He had his place in history, and was more than proud of it."

After a chauffeured ride to the center of the city, he arrived to the governor's home, where he, along with the Japanese Foreign Minister, waited at the door.\n\n Konstantin felt out of place among the refined aristocrats of Japan's bureaucracy, but he would have to charm them."

At least Japan could provide for its pick in the Russian anarchy via land - and Rodzaevsky would never renege on such a deal.

Sending an envoy headed by Rodzaevsky himself to Tokyo should hopefully do the trick. Surely they will be happy to give us the territory, we are on very good terms diplomatically.\n\nWhile we may have to give something in return, we expect nothing less than an agreement on equal terms from our diplomats.

The Manchurian government has been having bandit issues in the region for a while. It would help us to have it off our hands. Of course, we wouldn't mention any of it in the negotiations.\n\nHowever, the region is rich in iron, and we have a large mining operation in the region. If we give all of Outer Manchuria away, we could lose access to the vital deposits of the region. Although, we could make a deal with the Russians.

Rodzaevsky was confident the territory would be returned. They had gotten this far, hadn't they? The Japanese wouldn't have invited such a large delegation to Tokyo if they weren't interested.\n\nHowever, Japan may ask for something in return.

While Outer Manchuria may be relatively worthless to us besides the mines, Rodzaevsky and his government may do anything to reclaim their former territory, and we know that. Our representatives have requested full rights to the resources, not just the limited amount the Russians offered us.\n\nIn the end, we hope to receive a great deal from the Russians.

Now the Japanese have requested the rights to all the resources, not just the limited amount we were ready to give.\n\nWhile Rodzaevsky is fretted by this, he has no choice but to agree. Outer Manchuria must be regained, and Rodzaevsky needs the support of the newly liberated territories in the Far East. Besides, giving Japan the resources would surely increase our relations even further and show that we can be diplomatic. Perhaps this would open up even more options for us with the Japanese in the future.\n\nSo, with reluctance, Rodzaevsky has decided to agree to the Japanese proposal. While it may hurt us now with the loss of such a resource-rich area, surely it will be better for us in the long run."

It seems the negotiations have gone well for both parties.\n\nHopefully the bandits and terrorists won't be much of a problem for the Russians, but we no longer have to care.

The goal of a diplomatic victory has undoubtedly been achieved, and support for our regime has risen.\n\nThere have been far more boons than just the reclaiming of former Russian lands, however. Conducting a successful diplomatic negotiation with a superpower such as Japan has greatly increased our legitimacy on the world stage and within our own nation. More and more people are begging to support Rodzaevsky and the RFP government.\n\nUnfortanatly not everything is perfect, and within hours of our ownership of the province terrorist activity has been reported. It appears while Japan has given us back our former territory, they gave us a bandit problem too. Our Blackshirts are already on the case, having dealt with multiple bandit problems in the past, and we believe the terrorists will be a small stint in our great reclamation."

Once a high ranking officer of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army or NAJUA for short, Kim had risen to become the leader as Japan conquered China and Outer Manchuria, dashing his hopes of once again returning to Korea. Now he was a terrorist, hiding in bunkers and homes, and planning attacks on garrisons and railroads.\n\nAlthough, his successful campaigns were beginning to wane. Ever since the Russian government had taken over Outer Manchuria, the Russians were much more efficient than the Japanese at hunting down his group. Blackshirt raids on NAJUA hideouts continued to grow, and its members continued to dwindle.\n\nAs the sun set low over the horizon, Kim could no longer focus on his plans. What did they matter anyway? It's not like they had enough members to carry them out. The remnants of the NAJUA now hid out in this village, hiding in with the locals. Kim decided to head upstairs and maybe even get some sleep if he could.\n\nBut before he had even made it past the window, what he saw outside shocked him to his core. The Blackshirts had found them already! Dark trucks continued to pull into the village, emptying out large groups of Blackshirt soldiers, rounding up anyone they deemed suspicious. It would only be a matter of time before they decided to visit his home, and surely kill him on sight.\n\nHe had to escape while he still had time. Moving quietly out the back door, Kim ran into the deep forest just outside the village. Shouts came from behind him, but if the Blackshirts were chasing him, it was too late. Kim had prepared an escape plan just for this moment, and he already knew where the small safehouse miles deep into the forest was. But Kim knew he would never be able to reappear again. The NAJUA was dead, and another enemy to Japan's empire had fallen once more."

While the hulls may be slightly outdated and the ships stripped of their missiles, they are still state of the art compared to the rest of our navy. Better weapons and equipment capabilities far surpass our own designs, and we believe these ships will continue to be reliable for us years to come."

Fierce kitten - when Rodzaevsky found him on the street of his new domain, it scratched its face. No man would dare mess with the little kitten, he thought, brave and courageous in the face of absolute danger. Its coat was a patchy and rough criss-cross of monochrome, but its eyes were bright golden discs: God's gift to the Vozhd of Russians.\n\nAn aide entered. Rodzaevsky did not even notice the footsteps. Russia could wait; the world could wait; the Jews could wait. The party, Matkovsky, Mikhail - none of it mattered. The kitten's hisses and snorts mattered more than the aide's report. Its little tongue lapping the white richness in front of it soothed Konstantin's heart more than anything else. The feel of its fur, coarse and dirty, dusty and grimy, did not repulse nor frighten him. At his touch was a new life, unsullied and unsoiled by the machinations of the world hostile to his ideas.\n\n"Sir?" the aide said, "are you quite all right?"\n\n"Yes, moreover, what are you doing here?" Get out of here, Rodzaevsky thought. He was in no mood to send anyone to the firing line.\n\n"Nice kitty, sir."\n\n"No shit."\n\n"Have you thought of a name for it yet, sir?" The question troubled Rodzaevsky. He had not given it a thought. What would a good name for a bold kitten such as this one?\n\n"Mura. He's Mura. Now get out."

He turned to his bed. Once it had looked so warm and inviting, a haven to rest his thundering head and ignore the crushing bleakness of reality. Now, it was just an empty little distraction in the corner of the room.\n\nThere was much work to be done. The Siberian National State had spread far and wide, crushing all resistance under the glorious expanse of his army. Communist scum had fallen under the treads of his tanks, petty warlords had been eviscerated by the onslaught of his air force and degenerates had been gunned down by his brave infantrymen. His grand vision had brutally forced its way from the tiny frozen wasteland of Amur throughout the shattered realm of Siberia.\n\nHe was the Vozhd of the Russian People. His stagger had transformed into a purposeful stride. His depressed grimace had twisted into a sneer of superiority. Men did not look upon him with apathy or pity, but genuine fear and respect. Throughout the unconquered plains of Russia, ethnic Russian looked towards his impending triumph with joy, while the Judeo-Bolshevik rats scuttled away in horror.\n\nAn enticing bottle of Vodka was waiting for him. He wrapped his numb fingers around it, raised it to his parched throat... and stopped. With a grunt, he forced himself to pour a small glass, which he downed in one gulp. And another, just for good measure. History would speak of the Vozhd's rise to power as greater than Hitler's, and the story of the Russian National State greater than that of the German Reich. For the first time in decades, the sting of vodka and bile did not infect his mouth. Only the taste of victory."

Sycophantic murmurs of agreement broke out throughout the room. "A house may look grand, it may look powerful, it may look unyielding. But what happens if the foundations are weak?

They wanted someone younger, someone safer, someone more pliable to their whims. The fact that he had tolerated such men for so long spoke volumes to his former desperation. Now, however, it was time for change.\n\nRodzaevsky had drawn up the lists with sadistic satisfaction.
